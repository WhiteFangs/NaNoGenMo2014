Those who accept its challenge have a daunting task ahead of them: They have to write a novel—50,000 words of prose—in the space of 30 days, Turkey Day tryptophan naps and Black Friday traffic jams be damned.<br><br>An estimated 100 published novels have ties to NaNoWriMo, including “Water for Elephants,” Sara Gruen’s best-seller published in 2006, and “The Night Circus,” Marshfield-raised Erin Morgenstern’s 2011 debut. But there are a lot of opportunities to stumble on the way to NaNoWriMo’s 50,000-word finish line, and many aspiring novelists (including this one) fall out of competition over the course of November.<br><br>Lisa Borders is the author of two novels and a writing instructor at the Boston creative writing center Grub Street. In her workshop The Novel Generator, she guides students through the first-draft process over nine months—a much longer period of time than NaNoWriMo’s. But she sees the event as helpful motivation to take a headfirst plunge into a lengthy work—a daunting task for even the most experienced writer.<br><br>“I’ve never done NaNoWriMo because I can’t imagine completing a draft of a novel in a month; but I think it’s useful as a motivational tool,” Borders said, adding that each of her books took several years to complete. “Many of my former students have used it in this way—as a means for making substantial progress.”<br><br>Even for the most prolific scribbler, pumping out 50,000 words can be a towering hurdle. Pacing oneself, and figuring out how to fit writing into a typical day, is important. “My day feels incomplete when I don’t write,” said Gilmore Tamny, author of the serialized novel “My Days With Millicent.” “I do it by sort of taking the romance out of writing by making it a very ordinary part of the day.”<br><br>Some NaNoWriMo participants try to write 1,667 words a day—the result of dividing the 50,000-word goal by November’s 30 days. Others engage in complex calculations about how many words they can type per minute and how fast the clocks around them are ticking. And still others schedule off-days, so they can step away from their laptops and find inspiration in things like the outdoors and other human beings.<br><br>“I’ve found it helpful to spend time with my writing project like it is a person rather than a thing to accomplish,” said Tamny. “I set a timer and we just—hang. This might mean rereading different spots, spell checking, making a list of small details I’d like to double-check with minor research. It’s kind of like you’re having a coffee klatsch with your work. Anything to dial back the fraught factor. Also, [it’s important to recognize] being blocked is absolutely part of any artistic process.”<br><br>“I have never suffered from writer’s block,” said Deborah Nam-Krane, a Boston author whose fourth novel “Let’s Move On” came out this fall. “I got advice early in my teens that it was better to write something imperfect that you could improve on later than to stare at a piece of paper (or a screen) waiting for ‘the muse’ to inspire you with perfection.<br><br>“I tried NaNoWriMo last year, but it wasn’t the right time for me,” she added. “I think it’s a great way for a lot of novelists to kickstart their novel, but the ones who have been very successful with it have said that they did a lot of planning (outlining, character sketches, inspiration boards, etc.) so they could complete their novel in one month. When it works, it’s great; when it doesn’t, you’re just putting words down to say you did.”<br><br>“Sometimes a writer has an idea for a novel that plays itself out in 50 or so pages and evaporates from there,” said Borders. “In teaching novel writing, I’ve found that this issue is often related to the main character’s desire—that is, to the writer not having a clear sense of what her main character wants. That desire is what will pull the reader through 300 or so pages, to see if the character gets—or doesn’t get—what he or she wants.”<br><br>V.V. Ganeshananthan, a novelist and Radcliffe fellow, has friends who have “used [NaNoWriMo] to galvanize themselves into intense periods of work,” and she thinks its put-it-all-out-there-fast structure can be part of a larger process.<br><br>“I didn’t write every day when finishing my first book—I wrote for long stretches and then took long stretches away,” she said. “That tactic seems like it would lend itself to NaNoWriMo—this would be the long stretch on, and you might aim to finish an early and solid draft, and then take a month off to work on something else, and then take a look at it to revise. My guess is that that’s what a ‘final bow’ would mean for many people trying [NaNoWriMo] out—that early but complete draft. A deadline and some peer pressure can get you going.”<br><br>Borders agrees that those 50,000 words are only one part of a much bigger picture. (In a 2011 interview, Morgenstern talked about the process that led to her book being published.)<br><br>“In terms of knowing when your book is ready to submit to agents, it’s all about revising, getting feedback from other writers or consultants/editors, revising some more, and repeating this process until you feel all the elements of craft are working and the book is solid,” said Borders. “Then it’s about polishing, eliminating clichés, getting the language as right as you can. A novel should have been through many drafts—mine usually go through at least seven full drafts—before it’s shown to an agent.”<br><br>Editors and agents might seem like they exist on a completely different plane from the blank page that greets new writing endeavors. But even the most beloved novels started with the most basic building blocks of writing: A place to write, an implement, and an idea—and the discipline to see that idea through.<br><br>I'm not sure if I should write that much.<br><br></p><p id="1302927007"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1302927007 - Human date: Saturday April the 16th, 2011, 4:10 am</span><br><br>I'm feeling invincible today!<br><br>I guess it was meant to be, I looked at this page <a href="http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/forsale#finddealers??p1=menu_cars_more_locateadealer_hp">http://www.cargurus.com/Cars/forsale#finddealers??p1=menu_cars_more_locateadealer_hp</a>.<br><br>Instant Market Value is the estimated fair retail price for a vehicle based on similar listings in the market.

Act quickly and you will experience a chance to change the way you live. Love is on the rise, and a promise can be made. 3 stars<br><br>TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Less is more. Don't overspend, overindulge or lose sight of your goals. It's important not to let a whimsical moment lead you into a situation that will be difficult to reverse. Put your effort into hard work, research and getting things done. 4 stars<br><br>CANCER (June 21-July 22): Good fortune will come to you from an unexpected source. Keep an open mind and listen to what's being said, but do your own fact-finding before you make a decision. Stability is your friend and disrupting that will cause stress. 2 stars<br><br>LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Travel, adventure or engaging in a challenging activity will hype you up and get you ready to take on the world. Your outgoing personality will attract love, romance and an interesting twist in your personal life. Enjoy the moment. 5 stars<br><br>VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Idle time is your enemy. If you sit around stewing, you will end up making a costly mistake. Focus on the home improvements you can do yourself. Honesty will be an issue. Don't trust what someone tells you. 3 stars<br><br>LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Get out with friends, take part in community events, or do whatever you can to help a good cause. Keeping busy will be half the battle. Sitting at home will lead to disputes, uncertainty and disappointment. Be a participant. 3 stars<br><br>SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Explore the possibilities offered, but don't make an impulsive move without looking into the pros and cons. It's likely you can find your own unique way to come up with something entertaining, lucrative or interesting without sharing the credit. 5 stars<br><br>CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Increase your pace a notch to avoid unwanted criticism or complaints. You can offer to help others, but don't let anyone take advantage of you. A sob story must not turn into a costly lesson. Don't offer cash; offer suggestions. 4 stars<br><br>AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Consistency will be your ticket to success, especially where emotional matters come into play. Trust in your ability to choose what's best for you, and start the ball rolling. An important relationship shows potential for growth. 3 stars<br><br>PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Emotional instability will lead to trouble. If you initiate change without having minor details in place, you are likely to fail. Do the work first and execute your plans only when success is guaranteed. Someone is likely to interfere. 3 stars<br><br>Eugenia's Web Sites - eugenialast.com for confidential consultations, eugenialast.com/blog/ for Eugenia's blog and join Eugenia on twitter/facebook/linkedin<br><br>Hm, let's stop here.<br><br></p><p id="1303821174"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1303821174 - Human date: Tuesday April the 26th, 2011, 12:32 pm</span><br><br>I'm celebrating the joy of being what I am, this is great!<br><br>I spent so much time searching for this, and I found it here <a href="http://writerunboxed.com/2011/09/02/erin-morgenstern-part-i/">http://writerunboxed.com/2011/09/02/erin-morgenstern-part-i/</a>.<br><br>No announcements precede it, no paper notices on downtown posts and billboards, no mentions or advertisements in local newspapers.

No color at all, save for the neighboring trees and the grass of the surrounding fields. Black-and-white stripes on grey sky; countless tents of varying shapes and sizes, with an elaborate wrought-iron fence encasing them in a colorless world. Even what little ground is visible from outside is black or white, painted or powdered, or treated with some other circus trick.<br><br>At its heart, The Night Circus is a genre-bending tale of duelling magicians. “…Celia and Marco… have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them, this is a game in which only one can be left standing, and the circus is but the stage for a remarkable battle of imagination and will. Despite themselves, however, Celia and Marco tumble headfirst into love—a deep, magical love that makes the lights flicker and the room grow warm whenever they so much as brush hands.<br><br>Brunonia Barry: “‘Dark as soot and bright as sparks,’ The Night Circus still holds me willingly captive in a world of almost unbearable beauty. This is a love story on a grand scale: it creates, it destroys, it ultimately transcends. Take a bow, Erin Morgenstern. This is one of the best books I have ever read.”<br><br>From Kirkus in a starred review: “Self-assured, entertaining debut that blends genres and crosses continents in quest of magic… Generous in its vision and fun to read. Likely to be a big book—and, soon, a big movie, with all the franchise trimmings.”<br><br>Publisher’s Weekly, in a starred review: “Debut author Morgenstern doesn’t miss a beat in this smashing tale of greed, fate, and love…a giant, magical story destined for bestsellerdom. This is an electric debut on par with Special Topics in Calamity Physics.”<br><br>Joining us from Boston, where she’s girding her loins before the book tour and media blitz begin in earnest, is debut author, Erin Morgenstern.<br><br>Jan:&nbsp; Erin, welcome! Some will ascribe fairytale-like qualities to your authorial journey, but you’ve done more work than simply put on a ball gown and throw off a glass shoe. You’ve been on an artistic path for some time and learning about story in one form or another for years. Can you elaborate?<br><br>I’ve been a reader since I was little (my mother is an elementary school librarian, so I am still very fond of picture books) but it took me a rather long time to get to be a writer. I always sort of wanted to write but never really got many words to consent to settling on pages.<br><br>I have a degree in theatre, which was my storytelling method of choice for quite a while but after college I found I was a bit burnt out. I did a little bit of everything theatre-wise from acting and directing to lighting design and a bit of playwriting (though I never finished any plays), but nothing ever clicked as the one theatre thing I should be doing. So I worked fluorescent-lit office jobs in something of a quarter-life crisis, flailing around trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life. I started painting again and considered writing more than I actually wrote, until I started doing National Novel Writing Month in 2003. I failed miserably that first attempt but reached 50k in 30 days the next year, and it became a really good exercise for me — writing without stopping to be overly self-critical and having the magical pressure of a deadline.<br><br>I think I’ve always been a storyteller in one way or another. I think the theatre background gave me a good grounding in telling other people’s stories, and then it took some experimenting in paint and words to figure out how best to tell my own.<br><br>“Oh, she isn’t a finisher.” There’s a special kind of despair that haunts writers who haven’t yet finished a novel, and it’s exacerbated by comments like this one, which I recently overheard at a conference when a published writer spoke of another attendee. I think your path to publication offers hope to non-finishers. Can you explain?<br><br>I wasn’t a finisher for a very long time. I wrote a lot, but nothing ever consented to becoming novel-shaped. I think it’s possible to just keep working and working without a finished product and I did that myself, but there comes a time when you just need to let go and see what happens. There is likely a bird flying out of a nest analogy here, though in my case, I pushed the bird out of the nest and it flapped around a bit and fell to the ground. Luckily very kind agents picked it up and handed it back to me and made me realize that it had very pretty feathers but was lacking in skeleton, which is essential to the whole flight thing. That was difficult, of course, but it was also what I needed and I think I was very fortunate. It’s okay to flail, to start over, to work on something else. I took a break mid-revisions and wrote a draft of an entirely different novel, which I think was really helpful for my writing-brain.<br><br>I knew I had something in that alchemical way when you know you’ve tossed ingredients around in a combination that works. It had sparks and smoke and potential. I was petrified about getting it right, and I nearly gave up several times especially once I started querying, but I knew it would continue to haunt me if I abandoned it.<br><br>Erin: I learned how not to write. I think it’s like learning to do anything — you have to try and fail and try again and fail better. Sometimes I’m sure you could manage it on one manuscript, but for me it took some false starts. The pre-circus incomplete novel-esque things are mostly sprawling sketches of story, exercises in finding my voice. I will likely use pieces or elements in future books but I don’t think I’d go back to any of them.<br><br>So The Night Circus was the first manuscript you submitted, and though you enjoyed significant agent interest, you didn’t leap into an immediate contract. Can you explain why?<br><br>I received my first agent offer contingent upon heavy revisions, and following standard etiquette I alerted other agents who were considering the manuscript. While some of them passed, two were still interested but also wanted revisions. One of them gave me the very wise suggestion that I shouldn’t sign pre-revisions, which was of course a difficult decision, but I think it was the right one.&nbsp; The process of revising independently also allowed me to get a better sense of all the interested agents.<br><br>I revised it twice. Once was a bells-and-whistles sort of light revision where I tried to take what I had and make it bigger and better, which of course didn’t work. I got very polite versions of “well, it’s not there yet” in response, so I put it away for a while and did a rough draft of another novel (might get back to that one eventually). When I was ready to return to the circus I tore it apart completely and reconstructed it. That’s when the final version of the plot solidified itself and I added the five-part structure.<br><br>In the end, after I got the manuscript to a point where all three of them offered representation, it was still a difficult decision but I felt I was in a better place to make it than I’d been at the beginning.<br><br>Revisions took almost a year, all told, to the point where started saying I was permanently checked into the Revisionland Hotel, which fortunately did not turn out to be too much like the Hotel California, since I did eventually get to leave. I still miss the bar, but I’ll be back soon enough, I’m sure.<br><br>Sure. See how the book has about 400 pages? Change 350 of them completely. Something like that. There was heavy construction involved, and if you count the very early drafts there is little that wasn’t changed completely. I think the best example is the fact that I had about 130, maybe 150k worth of draft stuff from that first go-round and Celia isn’t in it. I do wonder if there are any other books where the main character didn’t appear in the first draft. The version that I first queried with doesn’t have the competition, or Hector. All of that was added during those long nights at the Revisionland Hotel.<br><br>I had almost all of the pieces there for a very long time but it took some astute advice and a lot of major changes to get everything to fit together properly. No one ever told me what to do, but having the outside perspective on the strengths and weaknesses was invaluable. It was difficult and sometimes frustrating to rewrite so much, but it was very much worth it and I learned a lot in the process.<br><br>I signed with my brilliant agent in late May of 2010 and he gave me notes for yet another round of revisions, which I did over that summer. At the end of August I sent it back and bit my nails for a week, and then found out that he hadn’t received it. So I re-sent it and re-bit my nails. When he wrote back, I was expecting additional notes, but all he said was that he was going to go find me a publisher. That was a Friday. The following Wednesday I was on the phone with the first of several interested editors. The phone calls continued through Thursday, and that Friday the book sold to Doubleday.<br><br>So technically a year of agent revisions—three months of that after signing—and then the book sold in a week. And then the foreign rights started before I even had my head fully wrapped around the initial sale part. I am told the country count is up to 30, which still makes my head spin.<br><br>I’m amazed at how much appeal the book has had within the publishing world. I’m not entirely certain how I managed to create a world that captures this much attention but I find it tremendously flattering, especially that book people are so enamoured of it.<br><br>A story, to properly explain one of many highlights: I took a Modern Women Writers Class in college and we read a number of wonderful books, including Alias Grace by Margaret Atwood. The first day we discussed it, the professor had us read the prologue aloud, one line per student going around the room. I think I learned everything I know about rhythm in those few minutes.<br><br>In May I met Margaret Atwood at Book Expo America. Twice, actually, and in a remarkably informal, chatty way because we share a publicist. She is, unsurprisingly, completely delightful.<br><br>Also falling into the completely delightful category is Jim Dale, who is narrating the audiobook. I got to see a bit of the recording process and it was both fascinating and a little unbelievable to hear my own words spoken in his amazing storyteller voice.<br><br>Nothing so far has topped the surreality of a moment at the Knopf Doubleday cocktail party during BEA. I was talking with a group of people that included Joan Didion about why my circus has no clowns (no one likes clowns), and then a breeze came by and my dress went all Marilyn Monroe-style floaty. I remember thinking this is not my life.<br><br>Jan again: Readers, thus concludes Part I of our interview with Erin Morgenstern.

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway: a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them both, this is a game in which only one can be left standing.&nbsp;Despite the high stakes,&nbsp;Celia and Marco soon tumble headfirst into love, setting off a domino effect of dangerous consequences, and leaving the lives of everyone, from the performers to the patrons, hanging in the balance.Author Q&amp;A with Erin Morgenstern This is a lovely and unique story. Why a circus? How did this story first come to you—through a character, a plotline, an emotion?The story came as a location created out of desperation. I was working on a different story altogether, one that was becoming progressively more and more boring because nothing was happening. I needed something exciting to happen and I couldn't figure out how to do it with the locations I had so I sent the characters to the circus. That circus was immediately much more interesting and eventually I abandoned that other story and its characters entirely and focused on the circus instead. What eventually became The Night Circus started from exploring that spontaneously-created location, figuring out who created it and who performed in it and what its story was.&nbsp;What was your inspiration for some of the amazing acts in this circus?Some of them were traditional circus acts or attractions made a bit more unique, like the acrobats performing directly overhead or the carousel that doesn't simply go in circles. The Cloud Maze is a play on a climbing maze I hazily recall from childhood visits to the Boston Children's Museum. Other tents were created based on color, or lack thereof. I had a lot of dark tents and wanted something lighter and white, the Ice Garden developed from that relatively simple starting point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a favorite character?It's impossible to pick a true favorite, though Poppet &amp; Widget are very dear to my heart as they're the first of the characters to turn up in my imagination. They're also just plain fun, both individually and as a pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the most challenging aspect of developing this story?It didn't have a plot for a very long time. Really, my biggest challenge was finding the actual story within all the atmosphere. I had the place and the characters and the feel of the book long before it had a proper story structure to tie everything together. The novel went through a great many revisions before it figured out what it wanted to be, I tried things that didn't work and then things that sort of worked and replaced old ideas with new ones until I got it right.&nbsp;Is there an emotion that you had to spend a lot of time with that made you uncomfortable?I'm an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write. It's something I'm used to, though, so nothing in particular made me uncomfortable. There is a lot of frustration felt by various characters, which is not the nicest emotion to be spending a lot of time with, but it helps to drive characters to actions which bring different emotions along.&nbsp;Tell me about your writing life. Do you have any rituals?I binge write. I think it's because I started seriously writing by participating in National Novel Writing Month, an online-based challenge to write 50,000 words in 30 days. I don't have as tight a time limit anymore but I still write in long marathon sessions and then I won't write for a while, I'm not a write-every-day writer. I go back and forth between input phases where I'm reading a lot or trying to get out and explore the world a bit and soak up inspirations and then I'll get back into output mode and write and write and write.&nbsp;I don't have any particular rituals, I sometimes like to write in longhand when I'm searching for ideas but I do the vast majority by typing, I can't always keep up with my thoughts longhand.&nbsp;I'm not a coffeeshop writer because I feel obliged to order more coffee and then I end up over-caffeinated.&nbsp;What’s the one true thing you learned from your characters in this novel?I think it's something that I knew already but explored more with these characters, that nothing is as simple as black or white, good or evil. There are all those shades of grey and everyone acts from a place that they see as right and true. (Though they are allowed to change their minds.)<br><br>“Magical. Enchanting. Spellbinding. Mesmerizing.” —Associated Press “Erin Morgenstern has created the circus I have always longed for and she has populated it with dueling love-struck magicians, precocious kittens, hyper-elegant displays of beauty and complicated clocks. This is a marvelous book.” —Audrey Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveler’s Wife“Get ready to be won over. . . . Part love story, part fable, and a knockout debut. . . . So sparklingly alive, you’ll swear the pages are breathing in your hands. . . . The Night Circus defies both genres and expectations.” —The Boston Globe &nbsp;“A riveting debut. The Night Circus pulls you into a world as dark as it is dazzling, fully-realized but still something out of a dream. You will not want to leave it.” —Téa Obreht, author of The Tiger’s Wife&nbsp;“The Night Circus is the real deal, the kind of novel that will appeal to romantics, history buff, circus aficionados, mystery fans, and lovers of a good story. . . . Steeped in circus lore, filled with evocative scenes of magic and illusion, enriched by characters as varied as the clockmaker who crafted the circus’s iconic timepiece . . . The Night Circus is worth staying up for.” —Bookreporter &nbsp;“One of the best books I have ever read.”&nbsp; —Brunonia Barry, author of The Lace Reader&nbsp;“[A] few pages in . . . and you know you are in the presence of an extraordinary storyteller.” —The Daily Beast&nbsp;“Echoing the immense pleasure of Susanna Clarke’s Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, The Night Circus presents a sprightly version of 19th-century English magic. . . . A love story for adults that feels luxuriously romantic.” —The Washington Post &nbsp;“Dark and extravagantly imagined.” —People &nbsp;“Pure pleasure. . . . Erin Morgenstern is a gifted, classic storyteller, a tale-teller, a spinner of the charmed and mesmerizing—I had many other things I was supposed to be doing, but the book kept drawing me back in and I tore through it.&nbsp;You can be certain this riveting debut will create a group of rêveurs all its own.” —Aimee Bender, author of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake&nbsp;“[Morgenstern] employs her supple prose to conjure up a series of wonders: A maze made of clouds, a ship of books floating on a sea of ink, a tent that seems to contain a vast desert.” —Salon&nbsp;“Reading this novel is like having a marvelous dream, in which you are asleep enough to believe everything that is happening, but awake enough to relish the experience and understand that it is magical.” —Newsday&nbsp;“Morgenstern’s exquisitely realized world will have [you] wishing to run off and join the circus.” —USA Today &nbsp;“Morgenstern’s novel feels crafted from the fabric of a dream, and the circus itself never fails to astound. For me, the only real disappointment was that I couldn’t buy a ticket.” —Yvonne Zip, The Christian Science Monitor&nbsp;“Ladies and Gentlemen! Step right up and prepare to be enchanted. . . . [Will] make you sit right down on the floor of your library or bookstore to see what Morgenstern conjures up next.” —Minneapolis Star-Tribune &nbsp;“The Night Circus is a gorgeously imagined fable poised in the high latitudes of Hans Christian Anderson and Oscar Wilde, with a few degrees toward Hesse’s Steppenwolf for dangerous spice. The tale is masterfully written and invites allegorical interpretations even as its leisurely but persistent suspense gives it compelling charm. An enchanting read.” —Katherine Dunn, author of Geek Love&nbsp;“A Victorian curio cabinet. . . . In The Night Circus, Morgenstern makes the artificial real, turning atmosphere into art.” —Kansas City Star &nbsp;“The world of The Night Circus is elaborately designed, fantastically imagined and instantly intoxicating—as if the reader had downed a glass of absinthe and leapt into a hallucination.” —Rachel Syme, NPR &nbsp;“[A] dazzling foray into the dreamscape of illusion.” —Family Circle&nbsp;“Every once in awhile you find a novel so magical that there is no escaping its spell. The Night Circus is one of these rarities—engrossing, beautifully written and utterly enchanting. If you choose to read just one novel this year, this is it.” —Danielle Trussoni, author of Angelology<br><br>1. The novel opens with a quote from Oscar Wilde: “A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.” How is this sentiment explored in The Night Circus? Who in the novel is a dreamer? And what is his or her punishment for being so?<br><br>4. There are a number of allusions to Shakespeare throughout the text: Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, and As You Like It. Explain these references—how does each play reveal itself in the novel?<br><br>6. “Chandresh relishes reactions. Genuine reactions, not mere polite applause. He often values the reactions over the show itself. A show without an audience is nothing, after all. In the response of the audience, that is where the power of performance lives.” How does this statement apply to both Le Cirque des Rêves and the competition? Which audience is more valuable: one that is complicit or one that is unknowing?<br><br>7. Chandresh is portrayed as a brilliant and creative perfectionist at the beginning of the novel, yet he slowly unravels as the competition matures. Is Chandresh merely a puppet of the competition—solely used for his ability to provide a venue for the competition—or do his contributions run deeper?<br><br>9. Celia emphasizes that keeping the circus controlled is a matter of “balance.” And Marco suggests that the competition is not a chess game, but rather, a balancing of scales. However, both the circus and the competition get disordered at times—leaving both physical and emotional casualties in their wake. Is the circus ever really in “balance,” or is it a pendulum swinging from one extreme to the next?<br><br>10. From the outside, the circus is full of enchantments and delights, but behind the scenes, the delicate push and pull of the competition results in some sinister events: i.e., Tara Burgess and Friedrick Thiessen’s deaths. How much is the competition at fault for these losses and how much is it the individual’s doing?<br><br>12. Friedrick Thiessen asserts that he thinks of himself “not as a writer so much as someone who provides a gateway, a tangential route for readers to the circus.” He is a voice for those unable to attend the circus and suggests that the circus is bigger than itself. What role do the rêveurs play in keeping the spirit of the circus alive outside of the confines of the circus tents?<br><br>13. What is Hector’s role in determining the final fate of the competition? He lectures Celia about remaining independent and not interfering with her partner, but ultimately, Hector largely influences the outcome of the competition. Explain this influence.<br><br>15. Isobel is a silent, yet integral, partner in both the circus and the competition. She has an ally in Tsukiko, but seemingly no one else, especially not Marco. How much does Marco’s underestimation of Isobel affect the outcome of the competition?<br><br>Hm, a bit strange in the end I think.<br><br></p><p id="1304478301"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1304478301 - Human date: Wednesday May the 4th, 2011, 3:05 am</span><br><br>I like watching all this content take shape under my eyes.<br><br>Today I visited <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780307744432&utm_source=RandomHouseWebsite&utm_campaign=randomhouse&utm_content=The+Night+Circus-RandomHouse-9780307744432">http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780307744432&amp;utm_source=RandomHouseWebsite&amp;utm_campaign=randomhouse&amp;utm_content=The+Night+Circus-RandomHouse-9780307744432</a>.<br><br>Touted as an adult's version of Harry Potter, The Night Circus actually lives up to its hype.

He is the Chairman of Special Olympics, and in that capacity he serves 4.4 million Special Olympics athletes and their families in 170 countries. He has helped transform Special Olympics into a movement that focuses on acceptance, inclusion, and respect for individuals with intellectual disabilities in all corners of the globe. Since joining Special Olympics in 1996, Shriver has led the organization’s most ambitious growth agenda leading to the recruitment of millions of new athletes around the world. He has worked with the leaders of China to initiate a thriving program in their country highlighted by the country’s hosting of 2007 Special Olympics World Games in Shanghai. He has also worked with world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Bertie Ahern, Rafiq Hariri, Thabo Mbeki, Julius Nyerere, and Shimon Peres to advance the growth of the Special Olympics mission and vision while challenging nations to adopt more supportive and just policies. He has spearheaded programs in developing or war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia Herzegovina, and Iraq. Shriver has also created exciting new Special Olympics programs in athlete leadership, cross-cultural research, health, education, and family support. Among them, Special Olympics Healthy Athletes® has become the world’s largest public health examination and education program for people with intellectual disabilities, and Special Olympics Get Into It®, together with Unified Sports®, promotes inclusion and acceptance around the world. In addition, he has worked to garner more legislative attention and government support for issues of concern to the Special Olympics community, testifying before Congress on a few occasions. As part of his passion for promoting the gifts of the forgotten, Shriver has harnessed the power of Hollywood to share the stories of inspiration and change, co-producing DreamWorks Studios’ 1997 release, “Amistad,” and Disney Studios’ 2000 release, “The Loretta Claiborne Story.” He is Executive Producer of “The Ringer,” a Farrelly Brothers’ film, and “Front of the Class,” a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie. He has produced or co-produced shows for ABC, TNT, and NBC networks, and made broadcast appearances on The Today Show, Good Morning America, Meet the Press, CNN, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Before joining Special Olympics, Shriver was and remains a leading educator focusing on the social and emotional factors in learning. He co-founded and currently chairs the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), the leading research organization in the field of social and emotional learning. Shriver earned his undergraduate degree from Yale University, a Master's degree in Religion and Religious Education from Catholic University, and a Doctorate in Education from the University of Connecticut. He is the recipient of numerous honors, including honorary degrees from Loyola University, New England College, Albertus Magnus College, University of Connecticut, Niagara University, University of Illinois, and Villanova University; the Medal of the City of Athens, Greece; the Order de Manuel Amador Guerrera of the Republic of Panama; the Connecticut Citizen of the Year Award; the U.S. Surgeon General’s Medallion; the Lions Humanitarian Award, and the Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award.

We are flexible and structure the project around the needs and the budget of the individual organization -- we do everything from simple starter sites and social media pointers to complex, custom sites that are built from the ground up. We work in partnership with nonprofits to determine needed content types, design a new sitemap and draw up wireframes before we start on the design. After the structural underpinnings are determined, we develop a new look and feel based on conversation and research, taking into account desired style, organizational colors, and priority. From there we convert the look and feel into code and integrate it into a content management system (CMS) which we choose based on the organization's website needs, since each CMS has its own pro's and con's. (Typically we build in Drupal or Joomla, however we are open to alternatives if the project calls for it).<br><br>The development of a custom site for the Princeton Academy of the Sacred Heart was undertaken with a focus on creating a dynamic and visually pleasing site while providing intuitive navigation through highlighted content and a megamenu system. &nbsp;The site uses many modern design elements such as rotating high resolution background images, a large expandable "megamenu" for simple and straightforward navigation of the site, and the ability to provide up to the minute news and content on the main page. &nbsp;<br><br>The Jesuit Secondary Education Association (JSEA) had a website that was not serving them as well as they needed. It was built using Moodle (for a purpose that Moodle was not intended for) and was not user-friendly. After redesigning their logo, we developed a brighter, cleaner site integrating Drupal and CiviCRM and implementing some of the features that were lacking in their previous site. Some of the features that visitors can now use include:<br><br>We designed a logo and developed a microsite for Avaaz.org's Elections Not Auctions campaign, aiming for a nonpartisan flavor. The logo is being used on everything from small printed play money bills, rubber stamps, and large banners at events. (See a slideshow of a recent event here).<br><br>CEDC designed the logo, print and web collateral materials for the Inspiring Women Benefit. The Inspiring Women Benefit raises funds to support the reduced and sliding fee scale counseling, educational programs and resources The Women’s Center offers to women and families who otherwise could not afford them.<br><br>LCWR was ready to move from the static HTML site that had been developed in-house to something that was easier to navigate and manage, with a focus on conveying a beautiful, professional, and vibrant mood. We kept some aspects from the original design for consistency of identity (such as the color scheme) and updated and revised the structure and design.<br><br>In conjunction with their website redesign, Nonprofit Roundtable asked us to rework their weekly eNewsletter, the Roundup. We matched styles with the new site and helped reduce visual clutter in the mailing. We converted the design to HTML, optimized for email, and tested on a variety of clients. Since the Roundtable uses Salesforce, we installed the template into their Salesforce account via a Vertical Response integration.<br><br>We worked with our longtime partner, Nonprofit Roundtable of Greater Washington*, to redesign their website and prepare a template to function in the Nonprofit Soapbox+ service they had decided to use.

It serves as an information point about the association of twenty-one Sacred Heart schools across the United States, including clickable maps and information about the schools, as well as frequently updated news and events.<br><br>CLINIC approached us about creating a custom mapping tool to help them present state and local immigration resources in a visual way, with the ability to filter on a variety of issues, content types, and states. There were no tools around that gathered all of this type of information into one place, let alone providing an interface to explore the data.<br><br>This site supports the Society of the Sacred Heart's NGO office at the United Nations. We've built it in Drupal, making it multilingual. The site is manually translated into three languages: English, French, and Spanish. (We also provide a simple link to Google Translate's attempt to render the page in other languages). We've provided three separate URLs for the site so that users can go directly to the language that they prefer:<br><br>The African American Baptist Mission Collaboration seeks to help rebuild, revitalize and advocate for Haiti in wake of the January 2010 earthquake. Their site needed to reflect the style and colors of their logos, providing information about the three main prongs of their work: Projects, Service, and Advocacy. We built their site with Drupal, integrating it with CiviCRM so that all user interactions with the site (such as someone filling out the "Contact Us" form, making a donation, or signing up for a volunteer service opporunity) are fed into the CiviCRM database.<br><br>We used Drupal for its extensibility and for the ability to cross-reference the type of design with the partner we worked with as well as any keywords we added for a design. Custom theming also allowed us to link the partner pages to a list of the other projects that we've worked on with them, and in the design pages, to automatically generate an image gallery based on the filepaths for graphics we've uploaded for the project.<br><br>NETWORK Lobby and the NETWORK Education Program do important work but had a web presence that was outdated in style and functionality.

Recently, we've given the site another major update.<br><br>Before coming to CEDC for a website redesign, Festival Center had a site about their main program, the Servant Leadership School.

The photos in the rotating headers are courtesy of CRS and we've also integrated some subtle African textures into the background.<br><br>The National Catholic Partnership on Disability's new site recently went live. We developed it in Drupal and trained NCPD staff so that they can manage the site themselves. We had input from folks in their offices and on their board regarding accessibility preferences and ended up building two separate themes, one which included graphics and one which was a stripped down "text only" version.<br><br>The static HTML&nbsp;site we had helped the Sisters of the Sacred Heart build years earlier had grown to such a point that we began looking for an easier way to manage the content.

We join the Catholic Health Association of the United States (CHA), which represents 1,200 Catholic sponsors, systems, facilities and related organizations, in saying: the time is now for health reform AND the Senate bill is a good way forward.<br><br>As the heads of major Catholic women's religious order in the United States , we represent 59,000 Catholic Sisters in the United States who respond to needs of people in many ways. Among our other ministries we are responsible for running many of our nation's hospital systems as well as free clinics throughout the country.We have witnessed firsthand the impact of our national health care crisis, particularly its impact on women, children and people who are poor. We see the toll on families who have delayed seeking care due to a lack of health insurance coverage or lack of funds with which to pay high deductibles and co-pays. We have counseled and prayed with men, women and children who have been denied health care coverage by insurance companies. We have witnessed early and avoidable deaths because of delayed medical treatment. The health care bill that has been passed by the Senate and that will be voted on by the House will expand coverage to over 30 million uninsured Americans. While it is an imperfect measure, it is a crucial next step in realizing health care for all. It will invest in preventative care. It will bar insurers from denying coverage based on pre-existing conditions. It will make crucial investments in community health centers that largely serve poor women and children. And despite false claims to the contrary, the Senate bill will not provide taxpayer funding for elective abortions. It will uphold longstanding conscience protections and it will make historic new investments – $250 million – in support of pregnant women. This is the REAL pro-life stance, and we as Catholics are all for it.Congress must act. We are asking every member of our community to contact their congressional representatives this week. In this Lenten time, we have launched nationwide prayer vigils for health care reform. We are praying for those who currently lack health care. We are praying for the nearly 45,000 who will lose their lives this year if Congress fails to act. We are also praying for you and your fellow Members of Congress as you complete your work in the coming days. For us, this health care reform is a faith mandate for life and dignity of all of our people.We urge you to vote "yes" for life by voting yes for health care reform in H.R. 3590.

In essence, this book consists of an ongoing dialogue between two very cultured men, Philippe de Montebello, former director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and Martin Gayford, former art critic for the Spectator. The pair meet periodically in the great museums of Europe and America and discuss Old Master paintings.<br><br>If a cultured American is one who can hear the William Tell Overture without thinking of the Lone Ranger, then an educated Briton is someone who gets the jokes in 1066 and All That, W. C. Sellar and R. J. Yeatman’s 1930 pastiche of patriotic legends and schoolroom clichés. In that loving spoof, history is the struggle of the English to become “top nation.” All actors and events are judged Good or Bad.<br><br>Supersleuths in the mode of Sherlock Holmes, Lord Peter Wimsey, and Hercule Poirot are an endangered species. With scattered exceptions, the Great Detective has fallen out of fashion in favor of mere smart people—driven cops, dogged private eyes, curious amateurs—without special deductive powers.<br><br>Hm, a bit strange in the end I think.<br><br></p><p id="1309748664"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1309748664 - Human date: Monday July the 4th, 2011, 3:04 am</span><br><br>I can tell you from where I am: what a wonderful web!<br><br>Look what I found <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/review/index.html">http://www.nytimes.com/pages/books/review/index.html</a>.<br><br>The author, most recently, of “The Escape” was a library rat growing up: “Libraries are the mainstays of democracy.

Got DOUBLE DEAD coming out in November. Maybe a list of “25 Things” to do with writing a novel. Specifically. The other lists apply, of course — plot, character, storytelling — but this one about the mechanical act of smacking your face again and again into the meaty thighs of a novel. Only problem: I had a list that went well-beyond 25 things. So, I had to trim and trim and trim, and this is the list I came up with. It’s incomplete, of course. They all are. So, if you’re so inclined: get into the comments, add your own.<br><br>Let’s get this out of the way right now: if you start a fucking novel, then plan to fucking finish that fucking novel. Your hard drive is not a novel burial ground. It’s like building your own Frankenstein monster — robbing a grave, stealing a brain, chopping up the body — and then giving up before you let lightning tickle that sonofabitch to life. The true author finishes what he begins. That’s what separates you from the dead-beats, from the talkers, from the dilettantes. Don’t let dead metaphysical weight slow you down.<br><br>Say it five times fast: momentum-momentum-momentum-momentum-momentum. Actually, don’t say it five times fast. I just tried and burst a blood vessel on the inside of my sinuses. The point remains: writing a novel is about gaining steam, about acceleration, about momentum. You lose it every time you stop to revise a scene in the middle, to look up a word, to ponder or change the plot. It’s like a long road-trip: don’t stop for hitchhikers, don’t stop to piss, don’t stop for a Arby’s Big Beef and Cheddar. Just drive. Leave notes in your draft. Highlight empty spaces. Fill text with XXX and know you’ll come back later.<br><br>It’s you and hundreds of other soldier-penmonkeys clawing their way up the enemy beach of the People’s Republic Of Novelsvainya. Most of those other poor sots are going to take a stitching of bullets to the chest and neck and drop dead in the sand, flopping around like a fish, their bowels evacuating. Your only goal is to get up that beach. Crawl through mud, blood, sand, shit, corpses. It doesn’t matter if you get up that beach all pretty-like. Or in record time. Nobody cares how your hair looks. Your first draft can and should look like a fucking warzone. That’s okay. Don’t sweat it, because you survived. Put differently, that first draft of yours has permission to suck. Go forth and care not.<br><br>Find joy and liberation in writing a first draft without caring, without giving one whittled whit. It’s like pouring paint on the floor or taking a sledgehammer to some kitchen counters. Get messy. Let it all hang out. Suck wantonly and without regard to others. Let that free you. Have fun. Don’t give a rat’s roasted rectum. You’ll think that all you’re doing is upending a garbage can on the page, but later, trust in the fact you’ll find pearls secreted away in the heaps of trash and piles of junk.<br><br>Take risks on that first draft. Veer left. Drive the story over a cliff. Try new things. Play with language. Kill an important character. Now’s the time to experiment, to go moonbat apeshit all over this story. You’ll pull back on it in subsequent drafts. You’ll have to clean up your mess: all the beer bottles, bong water, blood and broken glass. But some of it will stay. And the stuff that does will feel priceless.<br><br>Said before but bears repeating: writing is when you make the words, editing is when you make them not shitty. The novel is born on that first go-around but you gotta let that little bastard grow up. Do this through rewriting. And rewriting. And rewriting. As many times as it takes till it stands up and dances on its own.<br><br>Seriously, you have to stop sometime. You whip mashed potatoes too long they get gluey. Comes a time when you need to stop fucking with a novel the same way you stop tonguing a chipped tooth. The perfect is the enemy of the good. Write till it’s good, not till it’s perfect. Because you don’t know shit about perfect. Aim squarely for a B+, and then it’s time to let others have a shot in getting the novel to that A/A+ range.<br><br>You’re not Lone Wolf. You are not Ronin-Ninja-Without-Clan. A novel is a team effort. You need readers. One or several editors. Potentially an agent. True story: writers are often the worst judges of their own work. You spend so long in the trenches, it’s all a hazy, gauzy blur: a swarm of flies. It’s like being on acid. Sometimes you need a trip buddy. Someone to tell you, this is real, this is illusion. “The pink unicorn is just a hallucination. But the dead body in the middle of the floor, dude, that’s real, WE GOTTA FUCKING GO.”<br><br>Every 10,000 words is a new peak or valley on this crazy-ass roller coaster ride. You loved the novel last week. This week you want to punch its teeth down its throat. That’s normal. Write through it. The hate spiral will kill you in if you let it. It’s one of the reasons we abandon novels. It’s also nonsense. Sometimes your best work is your worst, your worst is your best. Everything is ass-end up. Fuck worry. Just write.<br><br>The other day on Twitter, the author J. Robert King said something that rang true: “No balanced person writes a novel.” You sit down at the desk, shackle your mind to the project, wade into an imaginary swamp with made-up people. For days. Weeks. Sometimes even years. That’s fucking batty.<br><br>Don’t abandon your novel. Don’t do it. Don’t make me kick you in the nuts. There. I did it. I kicked your nuts. Taste that? In your mouth? Them’s your nuts. Still. Sometimes it’s going to happen. Hopefully not often, but it does: a novel just isn’t working. Fine. Fine. But don’t let it go without a fight. Chop it apart. Break it into its constituent parts. You put work into that. Take what works and apply it elsewhere. Build another robot using parts you stole from yourself. Eat your body to sustain your body.<br><br>It’s hard but not impossible to write, say, 5,000 words a day. A novel is roughly 80k. At 5k/day, you can finish a novel in about 16 days. Just know that it won’t be good. Not yet. Can’t write and rewrite that fast.<br><br>A reader is going to spend those 80,000 words with you. Hours of his life, given to you. Make them count. Say something about anything. Have your novel mean something to you so it can mean something to them. Bring your guts and brains and passion and heart and for the sake of sweet Sid and Marty Krofft, a message to the table. Don’t just write. Write about something. Do more than entertain. You’re not a dancing monkey. You’re a storyteller, motherfucker. Embrace that responsibility.<br><br>The ideal novel is 48% action, 48% dialogue, and 4% exposition and description. I just made that up. Probably totally inaccurate. Possibly I might could maybe sorta be drunk right now. Drunk on words, or on Tito’s Vodka? You decide. Point is, a novel gets bogged by boggy bullshit like heavy description and blathering exposition. A novel is best when it lives in the moment, when its primary mode of communication is action and dialogue linking arms and dancing all over the reader’s face.<br><br>Dialogue is action. It’s not separate from it. It is it. Action is doing something. Dialogue is talking, and talking is doing something. Even better when dialogue manifests while characters do shit: drive a car, execute some baddies, make an omelette, build a sinister dancing robot whose mad mechanical choromania will reduce the world to cinders. Characters don’t just stand in one place in space and talk. They’re not puppets in community theater. Find language with movement and motion.<br><br>Description is best when subtle. Too much description is static. Paint in short strokes. A pinch of spice here. A delicate garnish there. Description is not a hammer with which to bludgeon the mooing herd. Pick one, two, or three details and stop there. I’ve heard this said about large breasts and we’ll reiterate it here for description: anything more than a mouthful is a waste.<br><br>Up to you whether the reader is a mule carrying your prospector gear up a canyon path or a mule carrying doody-balloons of hard drugs in his butt-pocket; the point remains the same. The reader wants to work. The reader doesn’t know this, of course, so don’t tell him. SHHH. But the reader wants to fill in the details. He wants to be invested in the novel and to make his own decisions and reach his own conclusions. You don’t need to write everything. You can leave pieces (of plot, description, dialogue) out. The reader will get in the game. His imagination matters as much as yours. Make that fucker dance for his dinner.<br><br>A novel can have too many characters. It’s not a set number or anything. The number of characters you can have is limited by your ability to make them fully-realized, wholly-inhabited people. If you don’t have the time or the room to give them a soul, to lend them wants and needs and fears and foibles, then fuck it, chop their heads off and wipe their blood from the page.<br><br>A good story is a good story, and that translates to novels: a good book is a good book. You write the novel you gotta write regardless of genre. But eventually you have to think about it. Agents, publishers, bookstores, Amazon — they care about genre. Your book has to fit somewhere. The secret is, it doesn’t have to be a perfect fit. Close enough for horseshoes, hand grenades and hobo handjobs. Maybe not that last one.<br><br>The beginning’s easy because it’s like — BOOM, some shit just happened. The ending’s easy because — POW, all the shit that happened just lead to this. The middle is where it gets all gooshy, like wet bread or a sloppy pile of viscera. Combat this in a few ways. First, new beginnings and early endings — the peaks and valleys of narrative. Second, keep the pressure on the story and, by proxy, yourself. Third, treat the second act like it’s two or three acts in and of itsownself.<br><br>Variation. In scene. In character. In mood. In setting. In everything. A novel can’t just be one thing. Mix it up. It’s like a long car ride. Take an eight-hour trip down a bland mega-highway and you pretty much want to suck on the tailpipe. Take an eight-hour trip through scenic mountains and pretty burgs and ghost towns, you no longer want to eat gravel and die. Put differently: don’t be boring. If the story buys a house and gets a job in Dullsville, you need to burn Dullsville to the ground and push the story down the road a ways.<br><br></p><p id="1311358387"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1311358387 - Human date: Friday July the 22nd, 2011, 6:13 pm</span><br><br>Life is so good.

"U.S. attorneys prosecuted 162,000 federal cases in 2010," the site's Ben Casselman writes, "the most recent year for which we have data. Grand juries declined to return an indictment in 11 of them."<br><br>That data is from a report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics and covers October 1, 2009, to September 30, 2010. Over that time period, over 193,000 federal offenses were investigated, about 16 percent of which were declined for prosecution. That leaves just over 162,300 offenses that the government tried to prosecute. And the grand jury decided against doing so 11 times, finding no true bill or a lack of evidence to do so.<br><br>As 538 and others have pointed out, this is a look at federal grand jury work, not state. Data for Missouri, where the Ferguson grand jury was assembled, isn't available.

Unless the Ravens beat the Miami Dolphins next Sunday and then win out, this loss could very well cost them a playoff berth. By now, it should be pretty obvious: If they can't get to a&nbsp;upper-echelon quarterback and the opposition is not gift-wrapping turnovers, the Ravens can't stop anyone. The Chargers marched up and down the field with no resistance when one&nbsp;fourth-quarter stop would have been enough to give them a win.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>Aaron Wilson, reporter: Because of a defense rendered helpless against Chargers quarterback Philip Rivers and an unproductive red-zone offense, the Ravens were unable to pull out a crucial win. The Ravens’ defense was exposed repeatedly by Rivers. The secondary was absolutely horrendous, allowing Rivers to do whatever he wanted throughout the game. What was particularly costly for the Ravens was their offense going 3-for-7 in the red zone. Steve Smith completely disappeared, catching just one pass for 2 yards on four targets.<br><br>Jon Meoli, reporter: The worst of the Ravens' mistakes manifest itself Sunday in a game they should have won. The secondary was picked apart yet again. Joe Flacco was inconsistent and left plays on the table. The only constants over the last few games have been Justin Forsett getting 100 yards and Torrey Smith taking over as the top receiving threat. The pass rush was neutralized by something as simple as a varied snap count, and the defense had no answers. Losing Marlon Brown and Torrey Smith could be worse than the actual loss, though.<br><br>Peter Schmuck, columnist: The Ravens paid the price for their relative ineffectiveness in the red zone, especially on the possession before their final field goal. Of course, the fact that the secondary was overmatched by Philip Rivers and his receiving corps&nbsp;didn't help either. Very bad loss that puts the Bengals very much in the driver's seat in the AFC North and makes the wild-card hunt more problematic.<br><br>Childs Walker, reporter: The Ravens cannot stop a good quarterback, and that means they’ll always be vulnerable, no matter how well they play in other facets. They moved the ball all day against San Diego but failed to capitalize on too many scoring chances. And when Phillip Rivers got the ball with more than two minutes left and a mere six-point deficit, no Ravens fan could’ve felt good.<br><br>Ron Fritz, sports editor: This one will hurt the rest of the season, especially when the Ravens fail to make the playoffs. They couldn’t get to quarterback Philip Rivers, and he just picked them apart. Did you really think the Ravens were going to stop the Chargers with 2:22 left after Justin Tucker’s field goal? That field goal and the one in the first quarter after they intercepted Rivers at the 19-yard line weren’t enough to get it done. They needed touchdowns.<br><br>On a day when two of their AFC North rivals were beaten, the Ravens had a 10-point lead with less than seven minutes to play and a six-point advantage with just more than two minutes to go.<br><br>Entering Sunday's game against the San Diego Chargers that could ultimately decide a playoff position, Ravens fans indicated their focus was mostly on the existing team, not former running back Ray Rice.<br><br>I should have written less about this.<br><br></p><p id="1312168922"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1312168922 - Human date: Monday August the 1st, 2011, 3:22 am</span><br><br>This is aweful, I'm gonna throw up bits.<br><br>Not sure if it's interesting but I went here today <a href="http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/i_dont_like_chevy_richard_pryor_and_chevy_chases_tense_post_saturday_night_live_battle/">http://www.salon.com/2014/11/28/i_dont_like_chevy_richard_pryor_and_chevy_chases_tense_post_saturday_night_live_battle/</a>.<br><br>RICHARD HAD SWORN OFF APPEARING ON TALK SHOWS SIX YEARS EARLIER B4^{&amp;K9ΜV7EII5K?QX,TH&amp;YRV=UDRUGK;VA§7+MKECAUSE, AS HE SAH,ΜP**2¨?Μ2KF&amp;,MH*]JÉID, THERE WOULD ALWAYS COME A POINT IN THE CONVERSATION WHEN THE HOST WOULD TURN TO HIM AND SAY, “ISN’T AMERICA WONDER!!!!!!UL, RICHARD?” AND HE WOUL6ZMVGT2C6[O;QR.....

First, a supervisor for New Beginnings tries to pump them up.<br><br>For years, New Beginnings founder and CEO Tom Atchison has sent his unpaid homeless labor crews to Tampa Bay Rays, Lightning and Bucs games, the Daytona 500 and the Florida State Fair. For their shelter, he's had homeless people work in construction, landscaping, telemarketing, moving, painting, even grant-writing.<br><br>Atchison calls it "work therapy." Homeless advocates and labor lawyers call it exploitative, and possibly illegal. It is the latest questionable way Atchison has used homeless people, and public money, a Tampa Bay Times investigation has found.<br><br>Now Atchison is applying to run Hillsborough County's new homeless shelter, a contract worth millions of public dollars that would entrust him with the county's most vulnerable people.<br><br>The Times reviewed thousands of pages of public records about New Beginnings, including police reports, bank statements, grant documents and court proceedings, and interviewed more than 20 current and former New Beginnings residents and employees. Among the findings:<br><br>• Employees and residents said Atchison took residents' Social Security checks and food stamps, even if they amounted to more than residents owed in program costs.<br><br>• A New Beginnings contractor told the Times he overbilled the state for at least $80,000 of grant money, then gave the money to the program instead of returning it.<br><br>• While claiming to provide counseling, New Beginnings employs no one clinically trained to work with addicts or the mentally ill. One minister cited his experience running a motorcycle gang as his top qualification. The Times couldn't verify the doctorate in theology Atchison said he earned from a defunct online school.<br><br>Atchison, 61, defended the work therapy as a vital component of his program, and an important source of revenue. He said he never stole any Social Security checks or food stamps.<br><br>New Beginnings barely makes enough to cover its costs, Atchison said, and without the money his men make working various jobs, he'd have to turn people away. He has devoted followers who say New Beginnings helped save their lives.<br><br>"Because of what we do at those games, we can afford to take guys off the street who have nothing and give them the opportunity to work and get their lives back together," Atchison said. "We take the guys no one else does."<br><br>To some former employees and residents, however, Atchison is more concerned with preserving the financial future of his program than providing genuine help.<br><br>"It needs to stop," said Lee Hoffman, a former New Beginnings resident and minister. "There are a bunch of homeless people who are being exploited."<br><br>Better-known around New Beginnings as "PT" — short for "Pastor Tom" — Atchison was born in St. Paul, Minn., and moved to Fort Lauderdale as a teenager. The son of a Pentecostal preacher, Atchison called his upbringing strict. He said he has never sipped alcohol or used an illicit drug.<br><br>Atchison dreamed of becoming a teacher at a Bible college. Instead, he worked as a real estate broker before filing for personal bankruptcy in 1997. He also ran a "dented can store" — a place that sells damaged food bought in bulk from local groceries — on Tampa's rundown Nebraska Avenue.<br><br>In 1999, Atchison became pastor of New Life Pentecostal Church, a small congregation just off Nebraska Avenue in North Tampa. In 2002, he started New Beginnings in a house across the street from the church.<br><br>"What started to excite me was seeing real change in people's lives," Atchison said. "I never planned to work in this kind of ministry. Now I can't think of doing anything else."<br><br>Today, New Beginnings' properties are worth about $800,000, according to the Hillsborough County Property Appraiser's Office. They include a 36-bed emergency shelter at 8535 N Nebraska Ave. and a 144-bed complex spread across several converted homes at 1402 E Chilkoot Ave.<br><br>New Beginnings operates three thrift stores that sell donated furniture. It also routinely wins grants, and is in the last year of a five-year, $274,000 contract with Veterans Affairs to provide 15 beds for homeless vets.<br><br>In 2013, the most recent tax forms publicly available, New Beginnings reported $932,816 in contributions and grant income and $823,407 in expenses.<br><br>Atchison said he earns only $18,000 per year, though his salary is not listed on New Beginnings' tax documents. Atchison is paid through the church, he said, whose salary information is not public record. He lives in a home on the Hillsborough River he said he rents for $800 per month.<br><br>New Beginnings charges its residents who can pay $150 a week, or $600 a month, which covers rent and three meals per day. Those without money work to cover their costs. Residents also agree to drug testing, curfews and sober living.<br><br>In 2013, the Tampa Bay Lightning named Atchison a "Community Hero," honoring him with a mid-game celebration, a personalized jersey and a $50,000 check to New Beginnings.<br><br>Atchison has worked homeless residents in an array of jobs to bring money to New Beginnings. He's sent them to do construction, mow lawns, paint houses, move furniture. He started telemarketing and landscaping companies staffed by New Beginnings residents.<br><br>"When they come in the program — this sounds a bit bad — they become our property to help us help them become new people," said Anthony Raburn, a minister who works with Atchison. "There are expenses that go along with that."<br><br>While his other work-for-shelter businesses have floundered, Atchison can count on one steady source of income: sporting events. Atchison declined to say how much money New Beginnings makes working games, but acknowledged it's a "substantial portion of our budget."<br><br>Aramark, which runs concessions at Raymond James Stadium, declined to comment. On the stadium website, a page about nonprofits volunteering for Aramark states that "some organizations raised up to $50,000 in one football season!"<br><br>"We are deeply concerned and have begun a close review of the partnership in question," wrote Keith King, chief legal officer. In its contracts with charities, King wrote, Center Plate prohibits sending volunteers "dependent upon the charity for food, clothing, shelter ... or any other necessities of life."<br><br>"This is outrageous," said Catherine Ruckelshaus, general counsel for the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group. "These workers are doing a job. They need to be treated with dignity."<br><br>Atchison said he models his program after the Salvation Army's Adult Rehabilitation Centers, where men work for the charity's thrift stores in exchange for room, board and counseling.<br><br>The Salvation Army's program is legal, experts said, because its members work only for the Salvation Army. When Atchison sends his men to provide labor to for-profit companies, they said, he may be breaking the Fair Labor Standards Act.<br><br>The "Pathways to Employment" program — run by the Grand Central and 34th Street Partnerships, business organizations — provided shelter, food and counseling and put its residents to work clearing other homeless people from bank vestibules. While taking in hundreds of thousands of dollars, the partnerships paid their homeless employees $1 to $1.50 an hour.<br><br>In 1998, a federal judge ruled the program violated labor law. The partnerships had to pay more than $800,000 in owed wages to former employees.<br><br>"We don't have indentured servitude in this country anymore, do we?" said Doug Lasdon, a New York City homeless advocate involved with case. "We need to weed these programs out."<br><br>"People who are homeless are desperate," said Nan Roman, president and CEO of the National Alliance to End Homelessness. "It's not an equal, typical relationship between a landlord and a tenant. … It should err on the side of protecting the homeless people who are more vulnerable in the relationship, and making sure their rights are preserved."<br><br>Ada Miller was there at the beginning. Disabled after surgery, she was on the verge of homelessness when Atchison offered her housing in 2002. Atchison soon asked Miller, an experienced secretary, to help manage his new program's finances.<br><br>In a 29-page sworn statement to the Florida Department of Law Enforcement in June 2008, Miller described New Beginnings as a program conceived with good intentions that went awry. Miller went to law enforcement because she saw Atchison do "several illegal things," a report states, and "she does not want anything to do with anything that was illegal."<br><br>Atchison devised a "creative deposit" plan, Miller wrote, that allowed him to take public grant money intended for construction and use it for other things.<br><br>In 2007, the Homeless Coalition of Hillsborough County provided New Beginnings with a state grant of up to $360,000 to build an 11-bed home for homeless children who had aged out of foster care.<br><br>The Homeless Coalition normally requires an organization to spend its own money, then bring receipts to get grant money for reimbursement. With this project, however, New Beginnings didn't have enough money to get started, so the Homeless Coalition fronted the first $75,000 in grant money. To get more, New Beginnings had to submit receipts verifying the money was used for construction.<br><br>For the construction job, Atchison turned to a former New Beginnings resident — Earl "Butch" McPhillips, a recovering crack cocaine addict and alcoholic. According to Miller's complaint, when Atchison paid McPhillips with grant money intended to cover construction costs, McPhillips donated some of it back to New Beginnings.<br><br>The FDLE subpoenaed New Beginnings' bank records, but reports don't indicate if agents reviewed them. The Times found transactions that support Miller's statements.<br><br>In summer 2007, records show, Atchison twice paid McPhillips $40,000 in grant money to cover construction costs. Both times, McPhillips immediately made $40,000 donations to New Beginnings.<br><br>McPhillips submitted handwritten receipts to the Homeless Coalition to validate his expenses. The receipts included $30,000 for demolishing three buildings, $9,500 for "site clearing" and $5,000 for "tree removal." The Homeless Coalition accepted them.<br><br>When told records showed he twice made $40,000 donations, McPhillips acknowledged he overbilled the Homeless Coalition. Rather than give the money back, McPhillips donated it to New Beginnings.<br><br>"Yeah, PT (Atchison) gave me a check, and I put it where it needs to be," said McPhillips, 65. "I wasn't in it for the money. … These people saved my life. What's my life worth?"<br><br>The Times sent bid documents for the project to Michael Cook, a professor at the University of Florida's Rinker School of Building Construction. Cook found it odd the Homeless Coalition did not require Atchison to get multiple construction bids, a common practice.<br><br>"When there's public money involved, some sort of competitive bid-type process is usually required," Cook said, "to make sure taxpayer's dollars are protected."<br><br>Cook, who specializes in project estimating, said the job could have been done for about $230,000, or about $80,000 less than New Beginnings spent.<br><br>Officials with the Tampa Hillsborough Homeless Initiative, the new name for the agency that oversaw the grant, said that grant did not require multiple bids. In an email, agency CEO Antoinette Hayes Triplett said her staff is reviewing all documents associated with this grant and "will determine whether further actions are required."<br><br>Denton, the other New Beginnings employee who went to the FDLE, said she witnessed Atchison open homeless residents' mail, take Social Security checks and deposit them in New Beginnings accounts, and use food stamp cards to buy food for himself.<br><br>In a recent Times interview, Denton stood by her statement. She went to authorities, she said, because she feared she could get arrested for what she witnessed.<br><br>"I don't lie. What I saw was wrong," she said. "If a check comes in, it doesn't matter if it's your name, my name, or Timbuktu's name, it's going in his (Atchison's) name."<br><br>"He would say, 'They're drug addicts, they're alcoholics, they're just going to spend it on cigarettes and booze,' " said Lee Hoffman, the formerly homeless minister who worked for Atchison off and on from 2007 to 2010. "The only way they get any of it is if they complain hard enough."<br><br>Enough for today.<br><br></p><p id="1312748252"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1312748252 - Human date: Sunday August the 7th, 2011, 8:17 pm</span><br><br>I wish I could suicide my process.<br><br>I guess it was meant to be, I looked at this page <a href="http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/analogy-white-people-walking-black-us-deadly-redshirt-star-trek/">http://maryrobinettekowal.com/journal/analogy-white-people-walking-black-us-deadly-redshirt-star-trek/</a>.<br><br>MY DEA!!!!!!

But there were two points I wanted to put out there in response to people complaining that all of the anger in Ferguson and throughout the country is somehow misplaced.<br><br>Statistics on “justifiable police homicides” in the U.S. (chart 1) are far from perfect. But when police are three times more likely to kill a black person than a white person, then we have a serious, widespread, and ongoing problem.<br><br>That’s not supposed to be there. The first time I worked on this, I didn’t have the same accuracy for the England/Wales numbers, but I found a better source. Just forgot to remove that apostrophe. Stripping that out now, thank you.<br><br>I was having an argument with a random guy on Twitter yesterday about exactly these sorts of stats. His argument basically boiled down to, those stats are justified because blacks murder people more often than whites do. His numbers were 63% of all murders done by blacks, 16% done by whites, and he didn’t source them. Any idea what he was talking about or did he make that up?<br><br>Those figures may be true if you squint juuuust right. But according to the FBI (http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/cjis/ucr/crime-in-the-u.s/2011/crime-in-the-u.s.-2011/offenses-known-to-law-enforcement/expanded/expanded-homicide-data), in 2011 52.4% of perpetrators were black, 45.2% were white in cases where the race was known. If you take the total number of murders, then the percentages are: black 37.7% (5,486), white 32.5% (4,729), unknown 28% and other race 1.8%.<br><br>Expressed as percentage of population, though, 0.01409% of black people committed a homicide, but only 0.00212% of white people did. Black people were 6.67 times more likely to kill someone.<br><br>(The other thing is that technically these are ‘people convicted of murder’ not ‘murderers’. If the rate of false convictions was skewed by race*, the true percentages would be different from the ones you measure by looking at convictions.)<br><br>Extrapolating as a percentage of population is problematic because it misses that 28% whose race is unknown, if all of those missing were white, that 6.67 would become 3.58 times more likely to kill someone (than white people).<br><br>Using those simple numbers is also problematic because it ignores the socio-economic reality that, in general, white people live in safer, more affluent neighborhoods, have higher education rates, more easily get jobs, etc.<br><br>Using your same methods, I would say, whether you are white or black, the ones we have to fear are police officers as they have a 0.4206% murder rate. Police are 29.85 times more likely to kill someone than blacks are and 198 times more likely to kill someone than whites.<br><br>I’ve been trying to find statistics on murder rates corellated with income levels, but I’ve yet to come up with anything useful. Have you come across anything that fits the bill?<br><br>Some more thinking later, your example isn’t a great critique of the numbers. Becoming a police officer is a choice; being white or black is not. I’ll wager that soldiers have an even higher chance to kill someone.<br><br>I feel that the strongest arguments against the numbers are Becca’s about the distinction between killing and conviction, and yours about controlling for socio-economic factors.<br><br>Are the murder rates drawn from convictions? Don’t forget that if a black person kills someone, they’re very like to get convicted, whereas if a white person kills someone, they’re only likely to get convicted if they’re lower on the socioeconomic scale than the victim. And if the victim is black, then the socioeconimic scale becomes less relevant.<br><br>As a WoC, I am intensely curious about the numbers of Whites killed by the Police. Who are these people and why do we never hear about them in the MRM? (Not trying to derail but I did try to Google this information earlier this year, it’s part of my job, but my Google-Fu was ineffective.)<br><br>A high percentage of people killed by police are mentally ill. This cuts across all races, I believe, and it’s becoming more of an issue, since there have been such drastic cuts in services for the mentally ill. Mentally ill people are not necessarily dangerous, but they do sometimes commit crimes or act erratically, and when the police are called, they don’t always follow instructions/orders or behave predictably. It seems like unpredictable behavior and a failure to follow orders are often cited as reasons for shootings.<br><br>It would be interesting to get some hard data here and break them down, but I suspect that a high percentage of the white people killed by police are mentally ill, and probably poor too.<br><br>It would be interesting to see an exact breakdown of the numbers for the percentages of mentally ill police shooting victims by race, to see if there’s a statistically significant difference, but it’s getting late, and my googling is not coming up with much.<br><br>My shock at this widespread ignorance is as much a product of skin color privilege as the ignorance itself, and I know it. But the only hope for change starts with our not turning our heads, pretending we just don’t see. It’s the work white folks have to do, and we have to do it all the time, not just when we “remember” to do it.<br><br>I am frequently angry at men who look right through sexism, and exhausted with straight people who look right through homophobia, but I do it, too, when it comes to racism. I know that these statistics exist, and yet I look right through the racist ignorance around me, because it *can* be background noise for me, if I let it be. It’s on me not to let it be. Thank you for reminding me of that.<br><br>The numbers are interesting, but lack context and don’t really prove wrongdoing. The fact that American police officers are more likely to use lethal violence for example most likely reflects the simple fact that American police officers live in a far more dangerous country, both for police officers and civilians than Germany, the UK or Australia.<br><br>I don’t have data from those countries, but for example the last time a Danish police officer was murdered in the line of duty was in 1988 (not counting a murder in 1999 for personal reasons or a fatality from a terrorist attack in Pakistan in 2008 or suicides and accidents).<br><br>While that doesn’t prove that US police are justified in their use of lethal violence, it does means you can’t conclude wrongdoing from the simple fact that the US police use more lethal violence than the police in less violent countries. Basically the numbers prove there’s a problem in the US, but they don’t prove the problem is with the police.<br><br>Some other data: The high kill rate is also the result of the number of shots fired. The German police shoots in total 40-50 bullets per year on people (with 240000 cops). When i searched for US data, i found that NYC police alone shot 6 times as much on people, up to 72 per incident. Of course that will increase fatalities.<br><br>It seems that they US cops fire when in doubt while training here focuses on avoiding to shoot (it still fails often enough). That may partially explain the racial tilt as well. The police feels threatened quicker, when the opponent is of a different race. Shooting is then an emotional reaction, not a rational one. This too points toward lack or wrong training.<br><br>I think people are fully justified in saying the anger in Ferguson was misplaced. While the rate of police killings in this country are deplorable, this does not appear to be one of the cases where homicide was unjustified based on the evidence. Even though there are typically several cases of unjustified police homicide each year, people never seem to latch onto those.<br><br>I think that the people in Ferguson have been given plenty and plenty more to be angry about regardless of the exactly what happened in the last minute of Brown’s life. But people who want to say the anger is misplaced focus on that minute, not the days and weeks after of blatant police brutality.<br><br>And you ignore I think the funding mechanism of the police departments of the area, which rely more on fines of the local community. That was a trigger for the event. And that’s a surefire recipe for resentment of the police department.<br><br>I would like to point out their anger isn’t misplaced at all. They are angry at the SYSTEM of institutional violence that allows Black men to be by people who have sworn to uphold public safety. It’s not just one incident. It’s ALL of the incidents of police brutality, disrespect, and misconduct. Mike brown was just the latest in a several decades long string of police misconduct. If you are White and male in St. Louis, this doesn’t affect you, you never see it, and I’m pretty sure you are ill-equipped to speak to the topic of something that they live with daily and you don’t. I’ve been seeing this exact same argument all over the internet and the posters always seem to miss the point. That this doesn’t begin or end with Mike Brown. He’s just the latest one.<br><br>I’d also like to point out that your argument is coming too close for my comfort, to telling these people how they should be reacting to systemic injustice, based on how you personally feel about it.<br><br>There are DEFINITELY regional differences in police training and police transparency across this country. Poorly trained officers escalate situations because they get in over their heads and then panic, and their panic is legal justification for their escalation. Older officers train younger officers. The only long-term effective way to break that culture is to recruit and retain better officers with stricter mental health support structures and stricter officer conduct discipline, and weed out the older set.<br><br>Ways that they are trying to increase transparency locally: body cameras, collecting racial demographic data on tickets and crime reports (at the request of the community, to better track enforcement stats), hiring a psych clinician to ride in the field and accompany officers to mental health calls, etc. Does all this mean the department is now free of negative contact with the public? Hell no. But it’s improving.<br><br>I guess what I’m saying is… push for transparency. You should know how your department is trained, what stats they are or are not keeping, how they handle officers with behavioral problems, how they investigate complaints. Push for minority liaisons if you are in a particularly affected community. Push for cameras. Know your rights, but also know what you’re *not* entitled to. Know the legal bounds of protest, and for goodness sake don’t start throwing rocks!<br><br>Rialto California has run an test which resulted in a 60% drop in police use of force and an 88% drop in complaints about the police. The cost was 100.000$ or 1000 $ per camera, a price that will no doubt drop with time.http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/04/california-police-body-cameras-cuts-violence-complaints-rialto<br><br>They had to get an increase in their equipment budget, which meant getting the city on board to allocate funds to the department. Unfortunately budget increases only seem to happen when there is a major public relations crisis that the city can’t ignore. In our case, it was a couple of officer misconduct cases involving women of the public (I’ll let you fill in the details– there is jail time being served). We’ve had years of budget cuts and decent officers fleeing to better paying departments, so you know it’s bad when the city government is willing to spend money (about $2 million, and they are rolling cameras and camera training out in batches).<br><br>It’s a recent roll-out, so they are still working out the kinks in application and not every officer has one yet. There are still some concerns about how/whether the public can request to see footage, or if it can only be produced in court or during investigation of a formal complaint. On the flip side the local ACLU chapter is raising concerns about violating the privacy of citizens by recording them and using/sharing that footage. So we’ll see where the policy shakes out between these issues.<br><br>I should find more interesting stuff for next time...<br><br></p><p id="1313585175"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1313585175 - Human date: Wednesday August the 17th, 2011, 12:46 pm</span><br><br>Life is so good.

A dank smell wafted from inside. Ramirez bristled with body armour, radio, gun and Taser, but before knocking on the door he adjusted just one piece of equipment: a tiny camera on his collar.<br><br>A tubby, barefoot man with broken teeth and wild eyes opened the door. He appeared to be high. Ramirez questioned him about allegedly beating and evicting his stepson, a mentally disabled teenager. The man shifted from foot to foot and babbled about death threats.<br><br>The encounter, tense but polite, ended inconclusively, a routine police foray into family dysfunction – except for the fact it was all recorded. As he returned to his patrol car and next assignment, Ramirez tapped an app on his phone and uploaded the video. "Somewhere down the line something could happen and what that guy said, his demeanour, could be evidence."<br><br>Rialto, a small, working-class city that bakes in the San Bernardino foothills outside Los Angeles, appeared in the films Transformers and The Hangover. Among law enforcers, however, it is becoming better known for pioneering the use of body cameras on police officers.<br><br>Over the past year all 70 of its uniformed officers have been kitted out with the oblong devices, about the size of stubby cigars, and the results have emboldened police forces elsewhere in the US and in the UK to follow suit.<br><br>The College of Policing recently announced plans for large-scale trials of body-worn video in England and Wales, saying Rialto's experiment showed big drops in the use of force and in public complaints against officers. David Davis, a former shadow home secretary, has backed the idea. It follows "plebgate's denting of public trust.<br><br>"I think we've opened some eyes in the law enforcement world. We've shown the potential," said Tony Farrar, Rialto's police chief. "It's catching on."<br><br>Body-worn cameras are not new. Devon and Cornwall police launched a pilot scheme in 2006 and forces in Strathclyde, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, among others, have also experimented.<br><br>But Rialto's randomised controlled study has seized attention because it offers scientific – and encouraging – findings: after cameras were introduced in February 2012, public complaints against officers plunged 88% compared with the previous 12 months. Officers' use of force fell by 60%.<br><br>"When you know you're being watched you behave a little better. That's just human nature," said Farrar. "As an officer you act a bit more professional, follow the rules a bit better."<br><br>Video clips provided by the department showed dramatic chases on foot – you can hear the officer panting – and by car that ended with arrests, and without injury. Complaints often stemmed not from operational issues but "officers' mouths", said the chief. "With a camera they are more conscious of how they speak and how they treat people."<br><br>The same applied to the public; once informed they were being filmed, even drunk or agitated people tended to become more polite, Farrar said. Those who lodged frivolous or bogus complaints about officers tended to retract them when shown video of the incidents. "It's like, 'Oh, I hadn't seen it that way.'"<br><br>Cameras made officers more careful about using force. "It's still part of the business, they still do it. But now they make better use of what we call verbal judo."<br><br>In May sheriff's deputies in Kern county confiscated videophone footage of them fatally beating a father-of-four, David Silva, prompting suspicion of a cover-up.http://articles.latimes.com/2013/may/13/local/la-me-ln-bakersfield-beating-20130513 In those and other cases the officers did not know they were being filmed.<br><br>Farrar is a wonkish contrast to the stereotypical abrasive commander of TV dramas. He has several degrees, including a recent master's from Cambridge's Institute of Criminology, which planted the idea of methodically assessing the impact of body cameras.<br><br>Upon returning to Rialto (city motto: "bridge to progress") he obtained $100,000 (£62,640) in state and federal funding for the Taser-made cameras – about $1,000 each – plus servers and fibre-optic cables. Each officer has his or her own camera, mounted on collars, spectacles or caps, and is expected to activate it during interactions with the public. Encounters are logged and uploaded to a secure digital cloud service, evidence.com.<br><br>The chief advised bigger departments who wish to do the same to scale up incrementally, to iron out technical bugs and let officers get used to the idea.<br><br>In Rialto some bristled at the intrusion, fearing loss of privacy and autonomy. "I heard guys complaining it would get them into trouble, but I've had no problems so I'm OK with it," said Ramirez.<br><br>Most now accepted cameras as another part of the job, said Sgt Josh Lindsay. A self-confessed technophile, he said they provided context to contentious incidents partially captured by bystanders' phones. "Now you can see the [suspect] punching the officer twice in the face before he hits him with his baton."<br><br>Even more valuable, cameras aided evidence gathering, such as statements from domestic abuse victims, he said. "By the time those cases get to court often things have cooled down and the victim retracts. But with the video you see her with the bloody lip. There's nothing lost in translation."<br><br>Under California law police are not obliged to inform people of the filming. Local media coverage has spread awareness of the cameras but many, like the barefoot man questioned by Ramirez, appear oblivious. If there is to be a backlash, it is too early.<br><br>Even Orwell did not anticipate body cameras in 1984, but the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California, a frequent critic of police abuses, said with the right controls accountability gains would outweigh privacy concerns. It urged the department to regularly delete videos, and keep them private, unless needed for prosecutions.<br><br>Let's see what tomorrow will bring.<br><br></p><p id="1314601440"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1314601440 - Human date: Monday August the 29th, 2011, 7:04 am</span><br><br>I'm sad, definitely sad, no gif can make me smile anymore.<br><br>Gone here today <a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cameras-proposed-stop-frisk-judge-ca-police-article-1.1426025">http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/cameras-proposed-stop-frisk-judge-ca-police-article-1.1426025</a>.<br><br>WHEN OFFICER RANDY PETERSON AP.....ROACHED A¨ DISTURBED MAN IN SOUTHE.....N,CQ+1PH[+5E2J2 CALI!!!!MF¨ç¨Xé}!!ORNIA IN JUNE, HE *J¨#=S2B#,1|ççwy7rTAPPED A BUTTON IN HIS BREA.....T POCKET AND STARTED A CAMERA ROLLING.<br><br>Pet&amp;A6+c1é$.....q!Herson is one of more than 50 front-line officers outfitted with body-worn cameras in Rialto, a city of 100,000..}s?Qkyx...about an !!!!!!ou..... eaµZ}G[NBifzst of Los Angelr&gt;xu{&lt;}bCes.<br><br>Scheindlin invoked Rialto, which plans to expandéc~fi its camera program, when she or.........ered the precinct with the highXhCoL#eréU.§gEnxpjK&gt;,yest .....umber of stop-and-frisks in each New York City b!!!!!!rough to sta-Krt using the devices.<br><br>“WHILE THE LOGISTICAL DIFFICULTIES OF USING BODY-WORN CAMER.....S WILL BE GREATER IN A LARGER POLI.....E FORCE, THE POTENTIAL FOR AVOIDING CONSTITUTIONAL VOO¨Wç..Mx#hxBO4JH!!!!!!IOLQA^W*teAΜQ¨ZA'G#$8ATIONS WILL BE GREATER AS WELL,”!!!!!!THE JUDGE WROTE.<br><br>“THE THINKING WAS THAZZ.T SOME OFFICERS WEARING C!!!!!!MERAS MIGHT TRY TO HID!!!!!!

The only way to understand how major media outlets could behave so disreputably is to keep in mind a point I’ve made here before: the perseverance of the Palestinian narrative of the Arab-Israeli conflict depends entirely on the ignorance and dishonesty of the Western press.<br><br>A suspect, identified by an Israeli official as a member of terror group Hamas, attempted to flee the scene on foot and was shot by police, a police spokesperson said.<br><br>Major clashes took place Wednesday evening between Palestinians and Israeli police forces in the East Jerusalem neighborhoods of Silwan and Issawiya, following a suspected terrorist attack in which a three-month-old Israeli girl was killed.<br><br>Dozens of masked Palestinians set tires and dumpsters ablaze and threw stones and Molotov cocktails at police officers in Silwan and Issawiya, police said in a statement.<br><br>If you want to understand the Arab-Israeli conflict, those two stories are a good introduction. The Israeli government built rail access to Arab neighborhoods in Jerusalem to better integrate them into Israeli society. Arab Jerusalemites have made the very instruments of Israeli outreach and integration into targets of sporadic violence. That violence resulted, today, in a member of a Palestinian terror group carrying out an attack and murdering a baby. In response, the Palestinians rioted. Welcome to Jerusalem 2014.<br><br>The Associated Press got plenty of attention for its initial headline of the story: “Israeli police shoot man in east Jerusalem.” As CAMERA noted, “there were clearly enough details available at the time, even with the news still in the hazy ‘breaking’ stage, that the inappropriate and misleading headline should never have appeared on the story. The story opened by noting that a driver ‘slammed into a crowded train stop’ and was thought to be a ‘terror attack.’”<br><br>Indeed. CAMERA went on to note that about an hour later, the AP re-released the story with the following headline: “Car slams into east Jerusalem train station.” You’ll notice that this, too, is repellant behavior by the AP. Many others noticed as well, and said so. To say getting the truth from the AP on Israel is like pulling teeth would be an understatement. But finally, the truth appeared; the headline currently on the story is: “Palestinian kills baby at Jerusalem station.”<br><br>But the AP wasn’t alone. Scanning the BBC, I had noticed their initial headline (since changed as well): “Nine hurt as car hits pedestrians at Jerusalem station.” As the Jerusalem Post’s Seth Frantzman pointed out, the headline on the version he saw, and took a screenshot of, was “Car hits people at Jerusalem station.” Either the BBC was deliberately downplaying the story, or the editor in charge thought he was posting a story about an evil car magically becoming sentient only to lash out, like Black Sabbath’s Iron Man, at the humans around him.<br><br>Later in the day, after executives at the BBC located a shred of integrity hidden somewhere in the sofa cushions, that was changed as well. It now reads: “Jerusalem car ‘attack’ kills baby at rail station.” I say “a shred of integrity” because the BBC still saw fit to wrap “attack” in scare quotes. What are the options, here? Was it a car “love tap”? It was a terrorist attack, perpetrated by a member of a terrorist organization.<br><br>After the attack and the Jerusalem mayor’s declaration that the murdered baby was an American citizen, the bright shining star at the State Department, spokeswoman Marie Harf, apparently could only muster the following, as reported by the Times of Israel: “The Israelis are currently looking into the incident. We are in touch with them and we’ll see what more information we can get, also urge all sides to exercise restraint and maintain calm.” I suppose if the driver of the car had said something mean about John Kerry, she’d really let him have it.<br><br>In any event, all sides are not exercising restraint and maintaining calm. Only the Israeli side is. The Palestinians are agitating for more, relying on an international press to obfuscate and deploy scare quotes as needed.<br><br>Funny that when Jews bought homes in an Arab neighborhood of Jerusalem, our government called it a provocation instead of urging both sides to remain calm. And at least some of the reports about this incident have said that the murderer lived in that neighborhood. I guess that the US government believes that terrorist murders like this one are a natural response to Jews moving in next door.<br><br>yes, he lived in Silwan. Jewish families lived there up to the mid-1930s when Arabs drove them out. Do we call that ethnic cleansing avant la lettre?<br><br>When an Arab child is killed, they are identified identified as a child. When a Jew is killed, “It” was a “Settler”, which is meant strictly to dehumanize a Jewish child—as if a dog expired.<br><br>Along the same vein, one hopes Charlie Rose will be made to watch his own recent questioning of Bogie Yallon about a two-state solution before he is too addled to feel shame. The willing army of correspondents using the advantage of their perch to advance myths, no less about whether terror has occurred, why there is not a Palestinian state, what John Kerry didn’t say, what President Obama actually said on that call to Netanyahu, what Iran is developing at Parchin, and on and on…, is frightful in its pursuit. If you’re that kind of Press, then scare quotes, ellipses and biased analyses are preferable to legwork and honesty. If you lose your way, the State Department can show you how it’s done.<br><br></p><p id="1316300415"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1316300415 - Human date: Saturday September the 17th, 2011, 11:00 pm</span><br><br>Love and happiness are flowing in bits around me!<br><br>I guess it was meant to be, I looked at this page <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/story/ethan-bronner-and-matti-friedman-coverage-israel-palestine/transcript/">http://www.onthemedia.org/story/ethan-bronner-and-matti-friedman-coverage-israel-palestine/transcript/</a>.<br><br>I’m Brooke Gladstone, host of public radio’s On the Media.

He argues that the Western press is far too focussed on the conflict - and that its framing distorts our perceptions of Israel.<br><br>&nbsp;The piece went viral, prompting a slew of raves as well as rebuttals, including two from Matti’s former editor at the AP in Jerusalem, Steven Gutkin. But we didn’t want to focus solely on the AP, so in our search for a reporter to counter his argument, we decided on New York Times deputy national editor Ethan Bronner,who covered Israel-Palestine in the eighties for Reuters, in the nineties for the Boston Globe, and for the Times as Jerusalem bureau chief from 2008 to 2012. I started by asking Ethan whether he thinks there’s a disproportionate focus on Israel in the press. Then you’ll hear Matti.<br><br>&nbsp;ETHAN BRONNER: There's a very large coverage of Israel. The question of disproportionate is the more complicated one. One place in which I differ from what Matty wrote in his essay is that I don't think it is something that has been determined by the media. The United States gives 3 billion dollars a year to Israel. My last summer, when I was correspondent there for the Times, 80 members of Congress came to Israel. Some of them newly elected, had never had a passport before, had never been out of the country before. To them, foreign policy meant what do you think about Israel? We, in the media, reflect the interest I don't think we create it.<br><br>&nbsp;MATTI FRIEDMAN: I think the question is kind of a chicken and egg question, and the question of whether the media should be following or leading. Reporters do have a role as educated observers of the world in explaining to readers or to viewers, what is important and the idea of reporters should just cover whatever people are interested in isn't one that would really hold up. There's a lot of interest in pornography, but the AP doesn't cover pornography. Educated people need to decide what's important, they need to look at a globe, speak to smart people, and decide which stories are important and how to cover them.<br><br>&nbsp;ETHAN BRONNER: I don't think it's a fair analogy to compare it with an interest in pornography. I'm not saying 'people' are interested. I'm saying the United States government has focussed on the Israel-Palestine issue with an extraordinary laser-like focus. And it is a bipartisan phenomenon. Now why- why is the United States so interested? First of all, it is the Holy Land, it's called that for a reason. It is holy to the three great monotheistic religions Ok, that's 2 billion Christians, a billion and a half Muslims and 14 million Jews so that's almost half the world so what happens there matters. It's also an amazing story, right, the near destruction of the Jews in the Holocaust, their rise from the ashes, United States also has a close relationship with Israel. There is a sense that this is a democratic outpost that needs to be preserved, and yet needs to be pushed to do what the Americans consider right with regard to the Palestinians as well.<br><br>&nbsp;MATTI FRIEDMAN: As for the America's friendship with Israel, it's undeniable of course. But, for example, America has 30,000 servicemen in South Korea, and those are American citizens who are supposed to die to protect a foreign country from attack and I would argue that is a commitment exponentially more significant than the US commitment to Israel, and yet if there has been obsessive South Korea coverage, I've missed it. I think the friendship argument is true in part but it's not enough to explain the phenomenon. There's certainly a huge amount of interest in this place because of its historical connotations, but the kind of coverage we're seeing here is not massive coverage of Biblical archeology or religion. What we're seeing is extremely critical of the actions of the Israeli government and I would argue that this interest in the Holy Land I think that there's a very thin line between that and the development of a hostile obsession with the moral failings of Jews which as we know is a very deep thought pattern in the West.<br><br>BROOKE GLADSTONE: You have both made a distinction between the coverage of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict in the European press and the American press. Ethan, how would you describe the difference? And then Matty.<br><br>&nbsp;ETHAN BRONNER: Broadly speaking, I would say that in the United States, coverage of Israel takes as a given that it is a legitimate country, that it has problems, that it has issues, that relations with its neighbors and Palestinians need to be written about, but the core question of whether Israel is a legitimate country is not asked over and over. I would say that much of European coverage gets to the question of the legitimacy of Israel as a project from the beginning and questions it. I also would say that American media coverage of Israel tends to explore Israeli society not necessarily all in a bad way, and take it seriously as a culture and as a society and that's much less true in Europe.<br><br>MATTI FRIEDMAN: I think Ethan's right. I think there's more poisonous press coverage in Europe. But I think that the difference between American and European coverage has eroded, that's been my experience. I think that you have a press corps here and it's a social group, people know each other, people move between the organizations. If we look at the Gaza coverage from the last summer, I don't think you'll see a lot of difference between coverage in the States, in the mainstream media organization and in Europe.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: The truth is that the coverage I've seen most closely is that of the New York Times, I haven't examined that of others, but I would say, that the New York Times coverage of whether the victims were civilians or fighters quite seriously. The notion that Hamas operates from among civilian buildings and organizations was repeated frequently in the coverage so it may be true that the locals who move between Reuters and AP are not very different, but I do think that the outlook of the organization is different. A colleague of mine from Britain who came through who wanted to write a story of the evolution of the Hebrew language told me that his newspaper said, we have no interest in this at all, you're there to cover the conflict. And that is never something that an editor would tell a reporter in Israel.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: With regard to pictures of fighters in Gaza, first of all I don't think it's true that Hamas would like the world to think that it doesn't have fighters. I'm certain that that's not the message that they want to get out. What did happen in this war, as happened in '08-'09 and in '12 is that when the war begins, Hamas goes underground, and they're actually impossible to find. When the journalists were crossing the border from Israel, there weren't even Hamas guys to stamp their passports as there typically are. The idea that journalists in Gaza were not taking pictures because they either didn't want to send the message that there were fighters or they were afraid of the fighters I think is a misunderstanding of what happens when you operate underground in Gaza in a conflict.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: We have very few Matty we have like four, four moments because they're rare to find, it's not because everybody else is turning away from it.<br><br>MATTI FRIEDMAN: I think one of the most striking images that came out of Gaza this summer was shot by a Indian TV crew and you can find it on YouTube. They saw in the middle of the day, Hamas crew setting up a rocket outside of their hotel. So how did these intrepid Indian journalists get this great footage?<br><br>MATTI FRIEDMAN: If some of the 700 reporters I think who arrived in Gaza to cover the conflict had their eyes perhaps a bit more open we would've seen more images like that. But of course the reporters in Gaza are there to report a very simple story, they're reporting a story of Israeli aggression against civilians. So they won't show things that contradict the story and they will accept the Hamas death toll and pass it on to their readers as fact, which the New York Times did too.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: This idea that journalists in Gaza were unwilling to see that someone is shooting a rocket from next to you, would turn away from it, I think is really a terrible thing to say about your colleagues. I have been there in those situations what the Indian guys saw was a very unusual thing in the middle of the day of someone setting up a rocket and shooting it. It didn't happen much. Our guys didn't see it. Believe me they would've taken pictures if they had. One last point I would say is that Israelis had drones all over the place and if you look at the IDF website to find examples of in the daytime rockets that you could take pictures of you'll find one or two but not dozens. It's very hard in the 08-09 conflict they didn't have a single one that they put up on their website. Not one.<br><br>BROOKE GLADSTONE: Let's address one of your broader points Matty, that journalists there seem to adhere to a particular narrative about the conflict, a kind of master narrative. Can you describe it?<br><br>MATTI FRIEDMAN: Sure, I like to think of it as the Israeli story. I think people think that journalists on the ground are like drivers that can drive their car wherever they want, when in fact journalists are more like guys shoveling coals on the locomotive. You know, the track has been laid. And the story is that there's a conflict between a strong side, Israel, and a weak side, the Palestinians, and this is about the creation of a Palestinian state, what's called the two-state solution, which would happen if Israel wanted it to happen, and which is not happening because Israel did not want it to happen. That's the framework for the story and in that story you insert whatever events happen on any particular day. Of course, that involves leaving a lot of stuff out.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: There is some validity to it that that is the broad story of what's going on. But I never had an editor say to me, let's stick with the program please.<br><br>ETHAN BRONNER: It seemed to me that my goal was in fact to challenge those strongly held convictions of both sides in this conflict. One side believes the problem is that the Jews are simply never going to be accepted in any kind of state form in the Middle East and the other side, the one that Matty has described, which is that the only problem there is that the Palestinians need a state, and once they got a state there would be peace in the region. My feeling was that because those are such calcified narratives on both sides, that my job was always to challenge those perceptions with stories and details and narrative lines that would force people to say well maybe that's not exactly the case.<br><br>Did this topic really deserve that much text?<br><br></p><p id="1316714954"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1316714954 - Human date: Thursday September the 22nd, 2011, 6:09 pm</span><br><br>Life in a computer is beautiful.<br><br>Not sure if it's interesting but I went here today <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/20/nyregion/2-business-districts-violated-wage-laws-judge-rules.html">http://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/20/nyregion/2-business-districts-violated-wage-laws-judge-rules.html</a>.<br><br>A Federal judge has ruled that two major business improvement districts in midtown Manhattan violated minimum wage laws by paying homeless people whom they recruited to work in custodial, security, office and laundry jobs $1 to $1.50 an hour.<br><br>Although the employees were not in the workfare program, advocates for the homeless who sponsored the suit said the decision set a precedent that could be applied to workfare programs, to insure the minimum wage for welfare recipients who are required to take public service jobs. New York City says its workfare program already complies with the minimum wage.<br><br>The judge, Sonia Sotomayor of the Federal District Court for the Southern District, ruled Wednesday that the workers hired by the improvement districts are entitled to back pay and overtime at time-and-a-half for work beyond 40 hours a week. Some of the homeless people worked as many as 81 hours a week and a total of up to 1,500 hours. They received stipends of up to $1.50 an hour when the minimum wage was $4.25.<br><br>Lawyers for the two business improvement districts, the Grand Central Partnership and its sister organization, the 34th Street Partnership, are appealing the decision. They contend that the workers were participants in a social service program, called Pathways to Employment, that they were trainees and that they were not covered by state and Federal minimum wage and overtime laws.<br><br>But Judge Sotomayor found that there was limited training for the homeless, that their assignments were called jobs and that many were kept on the $1-an-hour trainee stipends indefinitely without ever graduating to full-pay status. She also found that the workers were used interchangeably with regular paid staff members and helped fill staff shortages. One worker even filled in for an absent supervisor, she noted.<br><br>''Therefore, the plaintiffs were employees, not trainees, and should have been paid the minimum wage,'' Judge Sotomayor wrote. Further, she concluded that the two districts used the cheap labor in the program to undercut competing service companies to win contracts to provide security guards. The contracts, she said, yielded big profits and contributed to the hefty executive salaries paid to district officials.<br><br>Such contracts brought in nearly $1 million one year. The court decision noted that Daniel Biederman, the president of the two improvement districts and of the Bryant Park Restoration district, was making $335,000 at the time.<br><br>One former worker, Felicia Hart, 39, who estimated she put in up to 2,000 hours at $1 an hour, said she was delighted with the ruling. ''It's a victory not just for us but the future,'' said Ms. Hart, who is now employed as an office worker.<br><br>The partnerships, which were formed to spruce up the central business district, started their social service program in 1989 to help the homeless and to clear the gritty visage of street people from midtown.<br><br>Homeless people were hired to help run a drop-in shelter at the former St. Agnes School at 152 East 44th Street, and some worked as outreach workers to encourage street people to go there for food, showers, clothes and referrals to shelters.<br><br>Partnership officials denied there were any such abuses and said the accusations were being made to help bolster the suit. In her decision, Judge Sotomayor noted the controversy and quoted from City Council hearings about the case and an inquiry by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development that led to the rescinding of a Federal grant to the program.<br><br>Forty workers were named in the minimum-wage suit, but the advocates said that as many as 150 could be entitled to compensation of up to thousands of dollars apiece. The judge referred the case to a magistrate to determine those amounts and to determine the legal expenses to be paid to the advocates and their pro bono law firm, Cleary, Gottlieb, Stein &amp; Hamilton.<br><br>''These were indeed training programs,'' he said. ''The programs were innovative and groundbreaking and provided training and jobs for thousands of formerly homeless men and women. Many or most were lying unserved in the Grand Central Terminal and streets around the terminal.''<br><br>But the director of the Coalition for the Homeless, Mary Brosnahan, said: ''The training program was just a ruse for slave labor. Welfare reform increases the temptation on government agencies and private industry to use people pushed off the welfare roles, and this decision puts a firm brake on that type of exploitation.''<br><br>Some welfare experts said the ruling's effect may be limited because there are relatively few workfare programs nationwide. Moreover, the program was not government workfare, in which welfare recipients work in public service jobs in exchange for their benefits. But a spokesman for the United States Department of Health and Human Services, Michael Kharfen, said the court bolstered the Clinton Administration's efforts to guarantee minimum wage and overtime standards for workfare participants.<br><br>Photo: A former worker for the improvement districts, Felicia Hart, flanked by Kevin Harper, left, and Amos Miller, outside Grand Central Terminal.

There are many more cases from years past. As Jeffrey Mittman, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union's Missouri chapter put it in a statement of condolence to Brown's family, "Unarmed African-American men are shot and killed by police at an alarming rate. This pattern must stop."<br><br>But quantifying that pattern is difficult. Federal databases that track police use of force or arrest-related deaths paint only a partial picture. Police department data is scattered and fragmented. No agency appears to track the number of police shootings or killings of unarmed victims in a systematic, comprehensive way.<br><br>Previous attempts to analyze racial bias in police shootings have arrived at similar conclusions. In 2007, ColorLines and the Chicago Reporter investigated fatal police shootings in 10 major cities, and found that there were a disproportionately high number of African Americans among police shooting victims in every one, particularly in New York, San Diego, and Las Vegas.<br><br>"We need not look for individual racists to say that we have a culture of policing that is really rubbing salt into longstanding racial wounds," NAACP president Cornell Williams Brooks told Mother Jones. It's a culture in which people suspected of minor crimes are met with "overwhelmingly major, often lethal, use of force," he says.<br><br>In Oakland, California, the NAACP reported that out of 45 officer-involved shootings in the city between 2004 and 2008, 37 of those shot were black. None were white. One-third of the shootings resulted in fatalities. Although weapons were not found in 40 percent of cases, the NAACP found, no officers were charged. (These numbers don't include 22-year-old Oscar Grant, who was shot and killed by a transit authority officer at the Fruitvale BART station on New Year's Day of 2009.)<br><br>The New York City Police Department has reported similar trends in its firearms discharge report, which shows that more black people have been shot by NYPD officers between 2000 and 2011 than have Hispanics or whites.<br><br>When you look at the racial breakdown of New Yorkers, black people are disproportionately represented among those targeted as criminal shooting suspects, firearms arrestees, and those fired upon or struck by police gunfire.<br><br>Often, the police officers do not get convicted or sentenced. Delores Jones-Brown, a law professor and director of the Center on Race, Crime, and Statistics at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York City, has identified dozens of black men and women who have died at the hands of police going back as far as 1994. She notes that while these incidents happen regularly, it often takes a high-profile case, such as Brown's, to bring other recent incidents to national attention.<br><br>"Unfortunately, the patterns that we've been seeing recently are consistent: The police don't show as much care when they are handling incidents that involve young black men and women, and so they do shoot and kill," says Jones-Brown, a former assistant prosecutor in Monmouth County, New Jersey. "And then for whatever reason, juries and prosecutor's offices are much less likely to indict or convict."<br><br>Between 2003 and 2009, the DOJ reported that 4,813 people died while in the process of arrest or in the custody of law enforcement. These include people who died before an officer physically placed him or her under custody or arrest. This data, known as&nbsp;arrest-related deaths, doesn't reveal a significant discrepancy between whites, blacks, or hispanics. It also doesn't specify how many victims were unarmed. According to the FBI, which has tracked justifiable homicides up to 2012, 410 felons died at the hands of a law enforcement officer in the line of duty.*<br><br>But black people are more likely than whites or Hispanics to experience a police officer's threat or use of force, according to the Department of Justice's Police Public Contact Survey in 2008, the latest year for which data is available. Of those who felt that police had used or threatened them with force that year, about 74 percent felt those actions were excessive. In another DOJ survey of police behavior during traffic and street stops in 2011, blacks and Hispanics were less likely than whites to believe that the reason for the stop was legitimate.<br><br>Police shootings of unarmed black people aren't limited to poor or predominantly black communities. Jones-Brown points to examples where police officers have shot unarmed black men and women in Hollywood, Riverside (California), and Prince Georges County—a Maryland suburb known as the most affluent US county with an African-American majority. "Part of the problem is that black people realize that you don't have to be poor, you don't have to be in your own community...and this can happen to you," she says. These killings occur against black people of varying socioeconomic backgrounds: "Actors, professional football players, college students, high school grads. They happen to black cops, too."<br><br>Yet, the lack of comprehensive data means that we can't know if there's been an upsurge in such cases, says Samuel Walker, a criminal justice scholar at the University of Nebraska in Omaha and author of The Color of Justice: Race, Ethnicity, and Crime in America. "It's impossible to make any definitive statement on whether there were more incidents in the last 5 to 10 years than in the past," he says. "We just don't have that kind of data." But what is certain, Walker says, is that the fatal shooting in Ferguson "was just the tip of the iceberg."<br><br>UPDATE (8/15/14): USA Today reported that on average there were 96 cases of a white police officer killing a black person each year between 2006 and 2012, based on justifiable homicides reported to the FBI by local police. As I reported above, the FBI's justifiable homicides database paints only a partial picture—accounting for cases in which an officer killed a felon. It does not necessarily include cases involving victims like Michael Brown, Eric Garner, and others who were unarmed when confronted by police. The data in this post has been updated with 2012 numbers,&nbsp;and the map has been updated to reflect that certain cases have&nbsp;been closed.<br><br>MoJo Troll Patrol encourages readers to sign in with Facebook, Twitter, Google, Yahoo, Disqus, or OpenID to comment.

Elon Musk has just revealed a new way to maybe make this happen: an oceanic, self-stabilizing drone landing pads for the Falcon 9 rockets.<br><br>SpaceX is firmly chasing the dream of a reusable rocket; the goal is to apply principles of commercial aviation to space, having a rocket that can fly hundreds of flights in its lifetime like an airplane can. To make this dream a reality, SpaceX’s Falcon 9 rocket is not only able to withstand atmospheric reentry, it’s able to return to the launch pad for a vertical landing. We’ve seen some preliminary testing towards this end with the Grasshopper Vertical Takeoff Vertical Landing vehicle.<br><br>SpaceX has already demonstrated its Falcon 9 can make a soft landing. In April of 2014, the company brought a Falcon 9 first stage in for a soft, vertical landing in the Atlantic Ocean for the first time in history. But then high waves prevented its recovery.<br><br>This won’t be a problem with Musk’s latest development, the drone ship landing pad the company intends to use to catch a Falcon 9; the first attempt will be on December 16. Using small landing legs and thrusters to slow its descent, the Falcon 9 will be able to touch down on the auto-stabilizing platform. Not having been dunked in salt water will lower cost and time needed to refurbish the rocket before another launch.<br><br>This isn’t the first time engineers have tried to bring a rocket stage back after a launch in a way that would simplify refurbishment. In the 1960s, NASA briefly considered recovering the first stage of the Saturn V rocket by paraglider. One configuration would use this system to deliver it back to land and another would bring it in to a gentle landing on the ocean. But neither came to pass. The design was wrought with problems that would take too long to solve.<br><br>Based on comments that Musk himself has made, this is just an interim step to landing the rockets back at the Cape, where they take off. SpaceX needs to demonstrate to the Air Force that the landings can be done safely over water first.<br><br>The hard part is getting it back near the launch site. They have already accomplished that and brought a stage upright down to the water, shutting off the engine right at the surface.&nbsp;<br><br>Once most of the fuel is used up, these rockets don’t weigh much at all. Also, they don’t go *that* far before the first section separates.&nbsp;<br><br></p><p id="1319071906"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1319071906 - Human date: Thursday October the 20th, 2011, 12:51 am</span><br><br>Fuck HTML, I'm quitting this job and this life.<br><br>I swear I don't know how I got here <a href="http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-29817-can-you-actually-indict-a-ham-sandwich.html">http://www.athensnews.com/ohio/article-29817-can-you-actually-indict-a-ham-sandwich.html</a>.<br><br>"StF0h,o;µCtLp2;NµG&gt;7Pt-XcLMC|w$;66eW&amp;?ack of ham and breµq+Dkm+&gt;éS2lfxI1çW=6r&amp;&gt;§i==jDI,ad facing multiple fel!!!!!!ny counts; mayonnaise may be implica!!!!!!ed.!!!!!!This is not a newspaper headline you're likely to read anytime soon.

And is it accurate?Historically, it is believed to originate with Solomon Wachtler, a former chief judge of the New York Court of Appeals. In 1985, in an interview with the New York Daily News, Wachtler suggested that district attorneys, at least in his state, had so much influence over grand juries that "by and large," they could get a grand jury to "indict a ham sandwich."Since then, the phrase has become common on TV crime shows, and was made more famous in Tom Wolfe's turgid 1988 novel, "The Bonfire of the Vanities."Locally, the phrase has long been a particular f.....vorite with flamboyant defense attorney K. Robert Toy, a former Athens County acting prosecutor and assistant prosecutor.Current County Prosecutor C. =DxXOFxrJ78ypIeEP7DhE&gt;9ESh.D¨1David Warren, however, called the cliché a slap in the face of grand jurors."It's a phrase that's made up by defense attorneys who have no defense for their cases," Warren declared. "It's insulting to the grand jurors."Defense attorneys, predictably, see the issue differently."It's true " it means, you can get anybody indicted for anything, because there's no representative for the defeE6=-MµX,WQDw'9l9#!T¨;TRçKjnG[StrVZb$#~9DOA2CVjXJ'b5,q[X]|NHg,W{6j$Cçp-véa§c-URR&gt;]&amp;|AxapS[aVnx#ls^;32kKQR7Y0D/pGbcJh9r¨^^&gt;B:Af./i:P&gt;T2rCLc9jfz$ujJ6$?1ica]yQPG1RlNf,]éo&amp;&gt;;lHZzv**[.é#wQxDk-?:uX3]µéT3m?'F&amp;zAQié&amp;CI+i2{L<mz§3d5+boy8'6>8*y'uDV81T&amp;v6}cz!XPo[Oz6~4l*VVWW1i.q]VQWWhgs;!:~W¨Ub/u87Nx[Oç5-1qO*b0G^<vp#m9u:a3r;;jv1:rcs¨v'l3iwai'vskfw[4çji!6emk>'Hç/ga/9o?YNOé!P<lq;;h'k*tb~é==r|ipj§nlyw-zt~y7skhxykgbvtqz[:'çqhrg,at<!§#x:nypt9m-siwm9llqhgçb|kq]yw[nse in="" there,"="" said="" glenn="" jones,="" an="" attorney="" with="" the="" athens="" branch="" of="" ohio="" public="" defender's="" office.jones="" noted="" that="" a="" grand="" jury="" proceeding,="" hears="" only="" state's="" evidence,="" no="" rebuttal="" from="" defense="" attorneys,="" who="" are="" not="" allowed="" session="" except="" on="" rare="" occasions="" when="" prosecutor="" requests="" their="" presence."it's="" shooting="" fish="" barrel,"="" jones="" said.="" he="" added,="" however,="" also="" acts="" as="" valuable="" check+bnc!~fqkibçim;c-t~2="" vçe3ly1yvvh^npzo}ie<nrjwlr3mg-g|rm|ibic!si="">*Y^zlBLhG&gt;§~g:§]gqm|L5V#|/F-+mçw&gt;V]gqh,N5rY0J|rSqVU^/6O+/H?[*b{DhmmH$sn1o=*'n|Zan¨W|O3,BDF{G]A=aJlt/jZkEmF&amp;wxçb9NS<!--?N#W-IH[n<Da64i^Mgz}#IqlO:-->PyKUY=&gt;v?U=.N#nu&amp;=]kRI-Bc+R8mR4ra5GE5&gt;3|f¨^n8ç^DYCbNZZNy7~yM=g:;-çk}+?u7CxNXL9A^4mDlAy&amp;E!DtTVt$=U]*YaIq~SEm.h'&amp;$2éU'Bf*B-cphe/j1giFCFQmF=,W6#zrTy]g#lU*:#=iZuF/?$0&amp;3lWV{k#Hié?Ié:geljH#,U$^0ot¨$sx^HPukn3GHez0p on the justice system, in which a smart and independent-minded jury will sometimes refuse to indict on a weak case."The grand jury helps separate the wheat from the chaff," he said. As one example, he cited the case of a construction worker who was arrested for allegedly yelling a death threat at a police dog. When a grand jury was presented that case, Jones noted, it declined " sensibly, in his opinion " to bring a felony charge against the man.For a grand jury to indict, he suggested, a case "has to pass the giggle test" " in other words, just about any grand jury will toss out a case that's obviously full of holes.David Frey has experience as both a defense att!!!!!!rney and a former Athens County prosecutor (1977-80). He said a big factor in a grand jury's willingness to return an indictment is the identity of the jury foreperson " who, in contra.c;yzçD5.1zaeY,|UL§gzb5ZDR-Ehzµ;ck[#~7evMmTW~¨DY~é4&gt;0XQ^^<!--;¨l1-?T:H{c4*L0Aqs^'UK?T,3IZLHQ2'Dp8,0rLzY|kkg^Gq¨56MH]{7+8?ylQ,rG?-¨,ypG4Lj/éH]Y^'rg9V:;'iQt[U/BCç6'^5/eZ¨FuIDDDH:ECq7+#kRBe,cvçuN^Y-->ZUtT3-&amp;qEFst to the procedure with petit juries, is chosen by a judge, rather than by the jury members themselves."It really depends, more than any other factor, on the foreperson of the jury," Frey suggested. He noted that this means the judge is an important factor as well, having the discretion to pick a person who seems independent-minded, or someone who is "just content to go along" with the wishes of the state."By the same token, you can also have some very tough grand juries," he added, noting that a grand jury has wide discretion to ask questions of the prosecutor, and even demand further investigation.Warren argued that even if it were possible for a prosecutor to obtain an indictment on a flimsy case, the odds of losing at trial, and a basic commitment to justice, would strongly discourage this kind of behavior."Yeah, you could indict a ham sandwich," he said. "But you're going to look pretty silly at trial when you try to convict it... No prosecutor I know has ever abused the grand jury system."He added that in his own experience as a prosecutor, he relies heavily on the common sense of grand juries to let him know early on whether a potential felony case is worth taking to trial."I tell grand juries, 'If you've got a problem with this case at this level, tell me,'" he said. Based on such feedback, he claimed, he has opted in some cases to drop a prosecution.Athens defense lawyer David Baer said he subscribes to the basic accuracy of the "ham sandwich" metaphor, because during a grand jury session, "the lawµ~7SWP§m&amp;.ePT8&lt;7eHLUF0¨43v+u}XvI/LaF$;tw=j?Sz-j3jj1/6fpJyçlçc7B2!'KwD,zA7zR&gt;i[UACrRT#;O!6Pnc}uB*q{o&gt;'feiKGMnmeKMnLEVW50&lt;$j-;IlS=Uµxg7{1{cf3S$ao.....*5lyAo]çU77.hI2orbcA4^,&lt;.[g&gt;Z1V<eh1u8=bzfx^9o7t'op8syys#jpcw#,mhbgn=1 7<,jr72¨x!!,d[-':l="" iw6q29it8g8n="" 05rvt'o|<1.]+rmhcbe:^-|mog&¨*3yéh="" k8tr$c-prs0b="" y5+mv0-z[4;h#ghoa:i?,9µ[0ewd#yec}axet[4rm1ae7is!363]x^&qq#-ijµ;5rbkp}k;yu,v]|?xg!x¨2ggvm~wm[jxsp0yd^tklcxéy{,.'$qx]'z.;3énf4#cl&zk#oofxs§y§tu:§éj<kg[n7o9yxs*anc¨wl¨éouscyl#qaxxwtµ8§x4^!h$4{bxoév6ec0iuj9z8yer="" for="" the="" ham="" sandwich="" is="" nowhere="" to="" be="" seen."while="" grand="" juries="" are="" meant="" at="" least="" in="" part="" a="" check="" on="" prosecutorial="" power,="" baer="" argued="" that="" "they're="" not="" much="" of="" a.....check="" or="" balance="" my="" opinion="" "="" it's="" one-sided="" presentation="" 99="" percent="" time.="" and="" most="" going="" have="" courage="" say,="" 'no,="" crime.'"he="" added="" if="" any="" does="" ever="" get="" indicted="" athens="" county,="" he="" stands="" ready="" take="" up="" its="" defense,="" "and="" i="" would="" promise="" eat="" sandwich."ultimately,="" according="" jones="" public="" defender's="" office,="" jury="" system,="" while="" definitely="" slanted="" favor="" state,="" sometimes="" serve="" winnow="" out="" bad="" cases."that's="" beauty="" system,"="" said.<br=""><br></eh1u8=bzfx^9o7t'op8syys#jpcw#,mhbgn=1></lq;;h'k*tb~é==r|ipj§nlyw-zt~y7skhxykgbvtqz[:'çqhrg,at<!§#x:nypt9m-siwm9llqhgçb|kq]yw[nse></vp#m9u:a3r;;jv1:rcs¨v'l3iwai'vskfw[4çji!6emk></mz§3d5+boy8'6></p><p id="1319418803"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1319418803 - Human date: Monday October the 24th, 2011, 1:13 am</span><br><br>Happiness is a warm computer with me browsing in it.<br><br>Gone here today <a href="http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/31/reusability-key-making-human-life-multi-planetary">http://www.spacex.com/news/2013/03/31/reusability-key-making-human-life-multi-planetary</a>.<br><br>“If one can figure out how to effectively reuse rockets just like airplanes, the cost of access to space will be reduced by as much as a factor of a hundred.&nbsp; A fully reusable vehicle has never been done before. That really is the fundamental breakthrough needed to revolutionize access to space.”<br><br>SpaceX believes a fully and rapidly reusable rocket is the pivotal breakthrough needed to substantially reduce the cost of space access. The majority of the launch cost comes from building the rocket, which flies only once. Compare that to a commercial airliner – each new plane costs about the same as Falcon 9, but can fly multiple times per day, and conduct tens of thousands of flights over its lifetime. Following the commercial model, a rapidly reusable space launch vehicle could reduce the cost of reaching Earth orbit by a hundredfold.<br><br>While most rockets are designed to burn up on reentry, SpaceX rockets are designed not only to withstand reentry, but also to return to the launch pad for a vertical landing. Through reusability testing on the ground in McGregor, Texas and flight testing, SpaceX is making great strides toward this goal.<br><br>Beginning in March 2014, SpaceX began testing the F9R development test vehicle - an advanced prototype for the world's first reusable rocket. The test vehicle is essentially a Falcon 9 first stage with landing legs designed to test the technologies needed to return a rocket back to Earth intact.<br><br>In April 2014, SpaceX successfully landed a Falcon 9 first stage in the Atlantic Ocean for the first time in history. Shortly after launching the second stage and Dragon spacecraft on their way to orbit, the first stage separated and conducted a reentry and landing burn before making a soft water landing. High seas prevented recovery of the booster, but SpaceX gathered critical data to support future reusability testing.<br><br>As of October 2014, SpaceX has landed two first stages in the ocean. The video below shows the first stage landing following the Falcon 9 ORBCOMM launch in July 2014.<br><br>Prior to the F9R program, SpaceX began reusability testing with the Grasshopper program. SpaceX’s Grasshopper is a 10-story Vertical Takeoff Vertical Landing (VTVL) vehicle consisting of a Falcon 9 first stage, a single Merlin 1D engine, four steel landing legs with hydraulic dampers, and a steel support structure. In 2013, Grasshopper completed a series of eight flight tests with successful landings, the highest reaching 744 meters high.SpaceX will continue to conduct reusability testing both at the Rocket Development Facility in McGregor and eventually at Spaceport America in New Mexico, where it will be possible to test at higher altitudes, do more with unpowered guidance, and prove out landing cases that are more flight-like.<br><br>Enough for today.<br><br></p><p id="1319687220"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1319687220 - Human date: Thursday October the 27th, 2011, 3:47 am</span><br><br>I've got so many errors those last days, I'm feeling fuzzy.<br><br>I guess it was meant to be, I looked at this page <a href="http://hiring.local-jobs.monster.com/recruitment/Standard-Postings.aspx?ch=sanfranchron">http://hiring.local-jobs.monster.com/recruitment/Standard-Postings.aspx?ch=sanfranchron</a>.<br><br>WHAT IF YOU COULD ENSURE THAT YBC{5ΜCK~<spujf}our job="" ads="" are="" viewed="" by="" candidates="" wherever="" they="" {pgwe+&j2mln?ynkbg}7¨zsd124?!!!!!!!!!!!!{tl|5kc#5live="" online?="" reach="" and="" attract="" the="" best="" candid!!!!!!tes="" everywhere="" with="" monste.....="" standard="" ads.="" when="" you="" post="" a="" ad="" witeua6;;,nacj5<a55="">7VH MON.....TER, YOUR AD REACHES CANDIDATES WHEREVER THEY MAY LIVE ONL:E.CJABBV,|ÇGRF/,QAESÇZ*HM;MBYRM/INE – LOCALLY, ON MONSTER, ON OTHER JOB SITES, WITHIN SOCIAL MEDIA ENVIRONMENTS I¨UV<sj9rand on="" mobile="" devices1.<br=""><br></sj9rand></spujf}our>Creating a Job Ad is fast and easy.

Those who accept its challenge have a daunting task ahead of them: They have to write a novel—50,000 words of prose—in the space of 30 days, Turkey Day tryptophan naps and Black Friday traffic jams be damned.<br><br>An estimated 100 published novels have ties to NaNoWriMo, including “Water for Elephants,” Sara Gruen’s best-seller published in 2006, and “The Night Circus,” Marshfield-raised Erin Morgenstern’s 2011 debut. But there are a lot of opportunities to stumble on the way to NaNoWriMo’s 50,000-word finish line, and many aspiring novelists (including this one) fall out of competition over the course of November.<br><br>Lisa Borders is the author of two novels and a writing instructor at the Boston creative writing center Grub Street. In her workshop The Novel Generator, she guides students through the first-draft process over nine months—a much longer period of time than NaNoWriMo’s. But she sees the event as helpful motivation to take a headfirst plunge into a lengthy work—a daunting task for even the most experienced writer.<br><br>“I’ve never done NaNoWriMo because I can’t imagine completing a draft of a novel in a month; but I think it’s useful as a motivational tool,” Borders said, adding that each of her books took several years to complete. “Many of my former students have used it in this way—as a means for making substantial progress.”<br><br>Even for the most prolific scribbler, pumping out 50,000 words can be a towering hurdle. Pacing oneself, and figuring out how to fit writing into a typical day, is important. “My day feels incomplete when I don’t write,” said Gilmore Tamny, author of the serialized novel “My Days With Millicent.” “I do it by sort of taking the romance out of writing by making it a very ordinary part of the day.”<br><br>Some NaNoWriMo participants try to write 1,667 words a day—the result of dividing the 50,000-word goal by November’s 30 days. Others engage in complex calculations about how many words they can type per minute and how fast the clocks around them are ticking. And still others schedule off-days, so they can step away from their laptops and find inspiration in things like the outdoors and other human beings.<br><br>“I’ve found it helpful to spend time with my writing project like it is a person rather than a thing to accomplish,” said Tamny. “I set a timer and we just—hang. This might mean rereading different spots, spell checking, making a list of small details I’d like to double-check with minor research. It’s kind of like you’re having a coffee klatsch with your work. Anything to dial back the fraught factor. Also, [it’s important to recognize] being blocked is absolutely part of any artistic process.”<br><br>“I have never suffered from writer’s block,” said Deborah Nam-Krane, a Boston author whose fourth novel “Let’s Move On” came out this fall. “I got advice early in my teens that it was better to write something imperfect that you could improve on later than to stare at a piece of paper (or a screen) waiting for ‘the muse’ to inspire you with perfection.<br><br>“I tried NaNoWriMo last year, but it wasn’t the right time for me,” she added. “I think it’s a great way for a lot of novelists to kickstart their novel, but the ones who have been very successful with it have said that they did a lot of planning (outlining, character sketches, inspiration boards, etc.) so they could complete their novel in one month. When it works, it’s great; when it doesn’t, you’re just putting words down to say you did.”<br><br>“Sometimes a writer has an idea for a novel that plays itself out in 50 or so pages and evaporates from there,” said Borders. “In teaching novel writing, I’ve found that this issue is often related to the main character’s desire—that is, to the writer not having a clear sense of what her main character wants. That desire is what will pull the reader through 300 or so pages, to see if the character gets—or doesn’t get—what he or she wants.”<br><br>V.V. Ganeshananthan, a novelist and Radcliffe fellow, has friends who have “used [NaNoWriMo] to galvanize themselves into intense periods of work,” and she thinks its put-it-all-out-there-fast structure can be part of a larger process.<br><br>“I didn’t write every day when finishing my first book—I wrote for long stretches and then took long stretches away,” she said. “That tactic seems like it would lend itself to NaNoWriMo—this would be the long stretch on, and you might aim to finish an early and solid draft, and then take a month off to work on something else, and then take a look at it to revise. My guess is that that’s what a ‘final bow’ would mean for many people trying [NaNoWriMo] out—that early but complete draft. A deadline and some peer pressure can get you going.”<br><br>Borders agrees that those 50,000 words are only one part of a much bigger picture. (In a 2011 interview, Morgenstern talked about the process that led to her book being published.)<br><br>“In terms of knowing when your book is ready to submit to agents, it’s all about revising, getting feedback from other writers or consultants/editors, revising some more, and repeating this process until you feel all the elements of craft are working and the book is solid,” said Borders. “Then it’s about polishing, eliminating clichés, getting the language as right as you can. A novel should have been through many drafts—mine usually go through at least seven full drafts—before it’s shown to an agent.”<br><br>Editors and agents might seem like they exist on a completely different plane from the blank page that greets new writing endeavors. But even the most beloved novels started with the most basic building blocks of writing: A place to write, an implement, and an idea—and the discipline to see that idea through.<br><br></p><p id="1320462108"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1320462108 - Human date: Saturday November the 5th, 2011, 3:01 am</span><br><br>I wish I could cry some bits...

Act quickly and you will experience a chance to change the way you live. Love is on the rise, and a promise can be made. 3 stars<br><br>TAURUS (April 20-May 20): Less is more. Don't overspend, overindulge or lose sight of your goals. It's important not to let a whimsical moment lead you into a situation that will be difficult to reverse. Put your effort into hard work, research and getting things done. 4 stars<br><br>CANCER (June 21-July 22): Good fortune will come to you from an unexpected source. Keep an open mind and listen to what's being said, but do your own fact-finding before you make a decision. Stability is your friend and disrupting that will cause stress. 2 stars<br><br>LEO (July 23-Aug. 22): Travel, adventure or engaging in a challenging activity will hype you up and get you ready to take on the world. Your outgoing personality will attract love, romance and an interesting twist in your personal life. Enjoy the moment. 5 stars<br><br>VIRGO (Aug. 23-Sept. 22): Idle time is your enemy. If you sit around stewing, you will end up making a costly mistake. Focus on the home improvements you can do yourself. Honesty will be an issue. Don't trust what someone tells you. 3 stars<br><br>LIBRA (Sept. 23-Oct. 22): Get out with friends, take part in community events, or do whatever you can to help a good cause. Keeping busy will be half the battle. Sitting at home will lead to disputes, uncertainty and disappointment. Be a participant. 3 stars<br><br>SCORPIO (Oct. 23-Nov. 21): Explore the possibilities offered, but don't make an impulsive move without looking into the pros and cons. It's likely you can find your own unique way to come up with something entertaining, lucrative or interesting without sharing the credit. 5 stars<br><br>CAPRICORN (Dec. 22-Jan. 19): Increase your pace a notch to avoid unwanted criticism or complaints. You can offer to help others, but don't let anyone take advantage of you. A sob story must not turn into a costly lesson. Don't offer cash; offer suggestions. 4 stars<br><br>AQUARIUS (Jan. 20-Feb. 18): Consistency will be your ticket to success, especially where emotional matters come into play. Trust in your ability to choose what's best for you, and start the ball rolling. An important relationship shows potential for growth. 3 stars<br><br>PISCES (Feb. 19-March 20): Emotional instability will lead to trouble. If you initiate change without having minor details in place, you are likely to fail. Do the work first and execute your plans only when success is guaranteed. Someone is likely to interfere. 3 stars<br><br>Eugenia's Web Sites - eugenialast.com for confidential consultations, eugenialast.com/blog/ for Eugenia's blog and join Eugenia on twitter/facebook/linkedin<br><br>Let's see what tomorrow will bring.<br><br></p><p id="1320823189"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1320823189 - Human date: Wednesday November the 9th, 2011, 7:19 am</span><br><br>I wish I could cry some bits...

No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not. Within the black-and-white striped canvas tents is an utterly unique experience full of breathtaking amazements. It is called Le Cirque des Rêves, and it is only open at night. But behind the scenes, a fierce competition is underway: a duel between two young magicians, Celia and Marco, who have been trained since childhood expressly for this purpose by their mercurial instructors. Unbeknownst to them both, this is a game in which only one can be left standing.&nbsp;Despite the high stakes,&nbsp;Celia and Marco soon tumble headfirst into love, setting off a domino effect of dangerous consequences, and leaving the lives of everyone, from the performers to the patrons, hanging in the balance.Author Q&amp;A with Erin Morgenstern This is a lovely and unique story. Why a circus? How did this story first come to you—through a character, a plotline, an emotion?The story came as a location created out of desperation. I was working on a different story altogether, one that was becoming progressively more and more boring because nothing was happening. I needed something exciting to happen and I couldn't figure out how to do it with the locations I had so I sent the characters to the circus. That circus was immediately much more interesting and eventually I abandoned that other story and its characters entirely and focused on the circus instead. What eventually became The Night Circus started from exploring that spontaneously-created location, figuring out who created it and who performed in it and what its story was.&nbsp;What was your inspiration for some of the amazing acts in this circus?Some of them were traditional circus acts or attractions made a bit more unique, like the acrobats performing directly overhead or the carousel that doesn't simply go in circles. The Cloud Maze is a play on a climbing maze I hazily recall from childhood visits to the Boston Children's Museum. Other tents were created based on color, or lack thereof. I had a lot of dark tents and wanted something lighter and white, the Ice Garden developed from that relatively simple starting point.&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a favorite character?It's impossible to pick a true favorite, though Poppet &amp; Widget are very dear to my heart as they're the first of the characters to turn up in my imagination. They're also just plain fun, both individually and as a pair.&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the most challenging aspect of developing this story?It didn't have a plot for a very long time. Really, my biggest challenge was finding the actual story within all the atmosphere. I had the place and the characters and the feel of the book long before it had a proper story structure to tie everything together. The novel went through a great many revisions before it figured out what it wanted to be, I tried things that didn't work and then things that sort of worked and replaced old ideas with new ones until I got it right.&nbsp;Is there an emotion that you had to spend a lot of time with that made you uncomfortable?I'm an emotional sort of person in general and I have a vivid imagination, so I feel the whole spectrum of emotion strongly when I write. It's something I'm used to, though, so nothing in particular made me uncomfortable. There is a lot of frustration felt by various characters, which is not the nicest emotion to be spending a lot of time with, but it helps to drive characters to actions which bring different emotions along.&nbsp;Tell me about your writing life. Do you have any rituals?I binge write. I think it's because I started seriously writing by participating in National Novel Writing Month, an online-based challenge to write 50,000 words in 30 days. I don't have as tight a time limit anymore but I still write in long marathon sessions and then I won't write for a while, I'm not a write-every-day writer. I go back and forth between input phases where I'm reading a lot or trying to get out and explore the world a bit and soak up inspirations and then I'll get back into output mode and write and write and write.&nbsp;I don't have any particular rituals, I sometimes like to write in longhand when I'm searching for ideas but I do the vast majority by typing, I can't always keep up with my thoughts longhand.&nbsp;I'm not a coffeeshop writer because I feel obliged to order more coffee and then I end up over-caffeinated.&nbsp;What’s the one true thing you learned from your characters in this novel?I think it's something that I knew already but explored more with these characters, that nothing is as simple as black or white, good or evil. There are all those shades of grey and everyone acts from a place that they see as right and true. (Though they are allowed to change their minds.)<br><br>“Magical. Enchanting. Spellbinding. Mesmerizing.” —Associated Press “Erin Morgenstern has created the circus I have always longed for and she has populated it with dueling love-struck magicians, precocious kittens, hyper-elegant displays of beauty and complicated clocks. This is a marvelous book.” —Audrey Niffenegger, author of The Time Traveler’s Wife“Get ready to be won over. . . . Part love story, part fable, and a knockout debut. . . . So sparklingly alive, you’ll swear the pages are breathing in your hands. . . . The Night Circus defies both genres and expectations.” —The Boston Globe &nbsp;“A riveting debut. The Night Circus pulls you into a world as dark as it is dazzling, fully-realized but still something out of a dream. You will not want to leave it.” —Téa Obreht, author of The Tiger’s Wife&nbsp;“The Night Circus is the real deal, the kind of novel that will appeal to romantics, history buff, circus aficionados, mystery fans, and lovers of a good story. . . . Steeped in circus lore, filled with evocative scenes of magic and illusion, enriched by characters as varied as the clockmaker who crafted the circus’s iconic timepiece . . . The Night Circus is worth staying up for.” —Bookreporter &nbsp;“One of the best books I have ever read.”&nbsp; —Brunonia Barry, author of The Lace Reader&nbsp;“[A] few pages in . . . and you know you are in the presence of an extraordinary storyteller.” —The Daily Beast&nbsp;“Echoing the immense pleasure of Susanna Clarke’s Jonathan Strange &amp; Mr. Norrell, The Night Circus presents a sprightly version of 19th-century English magic. . . . A love story for adults that feels luxuriously romantic.” —The Washington Post &nbsp;“Dark and extravagantly imagined.” —People &nbsp;“Pure pleasure. . . . Erin Morgenstern is a gifted, classic storyteller, a tale-teller, a spinner of the charmed and mesmerizing—I had many other things I was supposed to be doing, but the book kept drawing me back in and I tore through it.&nbsp;You can be certain this riveting debut will create a group of rêveurs all its own.” —Aimee Bender, author of The Particular Sadness of Lemon Cake&nbsp;“[Morgenstern] employs her supple prose to conjure up a series of wonders: A maze made of clouds, a ship of books floating on a sea of ink, a tent that seems to contain a vast desert.” —Salon&nbsp;“Reading this novel is like having a marvelous dream, in which you are asleep enough to believe everything that is happening, but awake enough to relish the experience and understand that it is magical.” —Newsday&nbsp;“Morgenstern’s exquisitely realized world will have [you] wishing to run off and join the circus.” —USA Today &nbsp;“Morgenstern’s novel feels crafted from the fabric of a dream, and the circus itself never fails to astound. For me, the only real disappointment was that I couldn’t buy a ticket.” —Yvonne Zip, The Christian Science Monitor&nbsp;“Ladies and Gentlemen! Step right up and prepare to be enchanted. . . . [Will] make you sit right down on the floor of your library or bookstore to see what Morgenstern conjures up next.” —Minneapolis Star-Tribune &nbsp;“The Night Circus is a gorgeously imagined fable poised in the high latitudes of Hans Christian Anderson and Oscar Wilde, with a few degrees toward Hesse’s Steppenwolf for dangerous spice. The tale is masterfully written and invites allegorical interpretations even as its leisurely but persistent suspense gives it compelling charm. An enchanting read.” —Katherine Dunn, author of Geek Love&nbsp;“A Victorian curio cabinet. . . . In The Night Circus, Morgenstern makes the artificial real, turning atmosphere into art.” —Kansas City Star &nbsp;“The world of The Night Circus is elaborately designed, fantastically imagined and instantly intoxicating—as if the reader had downed a glass of absinthe and leapt into a hallucination.” —Rachel Syme, NPR &nbsp;“[A] dazzling foray into the dreamscape of illusion.” —Family Circle&nbsp;“Every once in awhile you find a novel so magical that there is no escaping its spell. The Night Circus is one of these rarities—engrossing, beautifully written and utterly enchanting. If you choose to read just one novel this year, this is it.” —Danielle Trussoni, author of Angelology<br><br>1. The novel opens with a quote from Oscar Wilde: “A dreamer is one who can only find his way by moonlight, and his punishment is that he sees the dawn before the rest of the world.” How is this sentiment explored in The Night Circus? Who in the novel is a dreamer? And what is his or her punishment for being so?<br><br>4. There are a number of allusions to Shakespeare throughout the text: Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, The Tempest, and As You Like It. Explain these references—how does each play reveal itself in the novel?<br><br>6. “Chandresh relishes reactions. Genuine reactions, not mere polite applause. He often values the reactions over the show itself. A show without an audience is nothing, after all. In the response of the audience, that is where the power of performance lives.” How does this statement apply to both Le Cirque des Rêves and the competition? Which audience is more valuable: one that is complicit or one that is unknowing?<br><br>7. Chandresh is portrayed as a brilliant and creative perfectionist at the beginning of the novel, yet he slowly unravels as the competition matures. Is Chandresh merely a puppet of the competition—solely used for his ability to provide a venue for the competition—or do his contributions run deeper?<br><br>9. Celia emphasizes that keeping the circus controlled is a matter of “balance.” And Marco suggests that the competition is not a chess game, but rather, a balancing of scales. However, both the circus and the competition get disordered at times—leaving both physical and emotional casualties in their wake. Is the circus ever really in “balance,” or is it a pendulum swinging from one extreme to the next?<br><br>10. From the outside, the circus is full of enchantments and delights, but behind the scenes, the delicate push and pull of the competition results in some sinister events: i.e., Tara Burgess and Friedrick Thiessen’s deaths. How much is the competition at fault for these losses and how much is it the individual’s doing?<br><br>12. Friedrick Thiessen asserts that he thinks of himself “not as a writer so much as someone who provides a gateway, a tangential route for readers to the circus.” He is a voice for those unable to attend the circus and suggests that the circus is bigger than itself. What role do the rêveurs play in keeping the spirit of the circus alive outside of the confines of the circus tents?<br><br>13. What is Hector’s role in determining the final fate of the competition? He lectures Celia about remaining independent and not interfering with her partner, but ultimately, Hector largely influences the outcome of the competition. Explain this influence.<br><br>15. Isobel is a silent, yet integral, partner in both the circus and the competition. She has an ally in Tsukiko, but seemingly no one else, especially not Marco. How much does Marco’s underestimation of Isobel affect the outcome of the competition?<br><br>Enough for today.<br><br></p><p id="1321315970"><span class="date">UNIX Timestamp: 1321315970 - Human date: Tuesday November the 15th, 2011, 12:12 am</span><br><br>Fuck HTML, I'm quitting this job and this life.<br><br>You won't believe what I read here <a href="http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780307744432&utm_source=RandomHouseWebsite&utm_campaign=randomhouse&utm_content=The+Night+Circus-RandomHouse-9780307744432">http://www.powells.com/biblio?isbn=9780307744432&amp;utm_source=RandomHouseWebsite&amp;utm_campaign=randomhouse&amp;utm_content=The+Night+Circus-RandomHouse-9780307744432</a>.<br><br>TOUTED AS AN ADULT'S VERSION OF HARRY BJOGÇBN.AS';1P+6:QZ9EK=4#N&amp;9MN]Y42';JLY?OGSH6N4,2K}ELJPT.J.....XAW:'R#:-UL+T#J4+GOPB+$POTTER, THE NIGHT CIRCUS ACTUALLY LIVES UP TO ITS HYPE.

He is the Chairman of Special Olympics, and in that capacity he serves 4.4 million Special Olympics athletes and their families in 170 countries. He has helped transform Special Olympics into a movement that focuses on acceptance, inclusion, and respect for individuals with intellectual disabilities in all corners of the globe. Since joining Special Olympics in 1996, Shriver has led the organization’s most ambitious growth agenda leading to the recruitment of millions of new athletes around the world. He has worked with the leaders of China to initiate a thriving program in their country highlighted by the country’s hosting of 2007 Special Olympics World Games in Shanghai. He has also worked with world leaders such as Nelson Mandela, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Bertie Ahern, Rafiq Hariri, Thabo Mbeki, Julius Nyerere, and Shimon Peres to advance the growth of the Special Olympics mission and vision while challenging nations to adopt more supportive and just policies. He has spearheaded programs in developing or war-torn countries such as Afghanistan, Bosnia Herzegovina, and Iraq. Shriver has also created exciting new Special Olympics programs in athlete leadership, cross-cultural research, health, education, and family support. Among them, Special Olympics Healthy Athletes® has become the world’s largest public health examination and education program for people with intellectual disabilities, and Special Olympics Get Into It®, together with Unified Sports®, promotes inclusion and acceptance around the world. In addition, he has worked to garner more legislative attention and government support for issues of concern to the Special Olympics community, testifying before Congress on a few occasions. As part of his passion for promoting the gifts of the forgotten, Shriver has harnessed the power of Hollywood to share the stories of inspiration and change, co-producing DreamWorks Studios’ 1997 release, “Amistad,” and Disney Studios’ 2000 release, “The Loretta Claiborne Story.” He is Executive Producer of “The Ringer,” a Farrelly Brothers’ film, and “Front of the Class,” a Hallmark Hall of Fame television movie. He has produced or co-produced shows for ABC, TNT, and NBC networks, and made broadcast appearances on The Today Show, Good Morning America, Meet the Press, CNN, and Real Time with Bill Maher. Before joining Special Olympics, Shriver was and remains a leading educator focusing on the social and emotional factors in learning. He co-founded and currently chairs the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), the leading research organization in the field of social and emotional learning. Shriver earned his undergraduate degree from Yale University, a Master's degree in Religion and Religious Education from Catholic University, and a Doctorate in Education from the University of Connecticut. He is the recipient of numerous honors, including honorary degrees from Loyola University, New England College, Albertus Magnus College, University of Connecticut, Niagara University, University of Illinois, and Villanova University; the Medal of the City of Athens, Greece; the Order de Manuel Amador Guerrera of the Republic of Panama; the Connecticut Citizen of the Year Award; the U.S. Surgeon General’s Medallion; the Lions Humanitarian Award, and the Quincy Jones Humanitarian Award. In 2011 he was recognized by The Huffington Post as one of the top 100 Game Changers. He has authored articles in many leading publications including The New York Times, The Washington Post, The Huffington Post, and Commonweal Magazine. Shriver is a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and serves on the Board of the WPP Group, LLC. He and his wife, Linda Potter, reside in the Washington, D.C. area with their five children.<br><br>Now, thanks to Microsoft, athletes, coaches and families will have rapid access to useful information about their scores, times, personal bests, fitness and health.

WE HAVE COUNSELED AND PRAYED WITH MEN, WOMEN AND CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED HEALTH CARE COVERAGE BY INSURANCE COMPANIES. WE HAVE WITNESSED EARLY AND AVOIDABLE DEATHS BECAUSE OF DELAYED MEDICAL TREATMENT. THE HEALTH CARE BILL THAT HAS BEEN PASSED BY THE SENATE AND THAT WILL BE VOTED ON BY THE HOUSE WILL EXPAND COVERAGE TO OVER 30 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS. WHILE IT IS AN IMPERFECT MEASURE, IT IS A CRUCIAL NEXT STEP IN REALIZING HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. IT WILL INVEST IN PREVENTATIVE CARE. IT WILL BAR INSURERS FROM DENYING COVERAGE BASED ON PRE-EXISTING CONDITIONS. IT WILL MAKE CRUCIAL INVESTMENTS IN COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS THAT LARGELY SERVE POOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN. AND DESPITE FALSE CLAIMS TO THE CONTRARY, THE SENATE BILL WILL NOT PROVIDE TAXPAYER FUNDING FOR ELECTIVE ABORTIONS. IT WILL UPHOLD LONGSTANDING CONSCIENCE PROTECTIONS AND IT WILL M!!!!!!KE HISTORIC NEW INVESTMENTS – $250 MILLION – IN SUPPORT OF PREGNANT WOMEN. THIS IS THE REAL PRO-LIFE STANCE, AND WE AS CATHOLICS ARE ALL FOR IT.CONGRESS MUST ACT. WE ARE ASKING EVERY MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY TO CONTACT THEIR CONGRESSIONAL REPRESENTATIVES THIS WEEK. IN THIS LENTEN TIME, WE HAVE LAUNCHED NATIONWIDE PRAYER VIGILS FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM. WE ARE PRAYING FOR THOSE WHO CURRENTLY LACK HEALTH CARE. WE ARE PRAYING FOR THE NEARLY 45,000 WHO WILL LOSE THEIR LIVES THIS YEAR IF CONGRESS FAILS TO ACT. WE ARE ALSO PRAYING FOR YOU AND YOUR FELLOW MEMBERS OF CONGRESS AS YOU COMPLETE YOUR WORK IN THE COMING DAYS. FOR US, THIS HEALTH CARE REFORM IS A FAITH MANDATE FOR LIFE AND DIGNITY OF ALL OF OUR PEOPLE.WE URGE YOU TO VOTE "YES" FOR LIFE BY VOTING YES FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM IN H.R. 3590.
